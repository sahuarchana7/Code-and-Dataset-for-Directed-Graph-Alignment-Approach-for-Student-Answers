something like that; skipped

oh, you *did* do this change in the svn repo.  i didn't check both.  now i
see.

This causes the following unit test to fail.  i'm disabling it.

 // Disable the organization type check -- gives only slim gains on ACE eval
// and potentially complicates other analysis.
 // Causes data/they2  unit test to fail: TestArkref.testThey()

....

//The team practiced very hard, and later on they won the game.
 //The herd of animals grazed on the land, and then they moved on.
 d = Document.loadFiles("data/they2");
 _SimplePipeline.go(d);
System.out.println("!!!!   Disabled data/they2 test, fails since we disabled
the org check in Types.number()  !!!!");
 // assertLink(d,1,2);
// assertLink(d,4,7);
// assertNoLink(d,2,4);

oops, i think i misread this commit -- it actually didn't touch any arkref/
code.  arkref now uses a different method of detecting parse errors -- the
java interface to the parser now wraps up the result into a little data
structure, AnalysisUtilities.ParseResult, that includes a boolean whether
the parse succeeded; and the textual protocol includes this information as
well.  This data structure is made to disappear during integration time when
creating the Document with all its Sentences; then, each Sentence object has
a boolean, hasParse with this information.
