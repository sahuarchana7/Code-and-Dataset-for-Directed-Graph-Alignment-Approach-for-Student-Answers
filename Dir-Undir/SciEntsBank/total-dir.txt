EM.33b.432.1  I know because the paperclip is a harder tool so if a softer tool can scratch it so can the paperclip.
EM.33b.436.1  A paperclip is harder because one scratched the penny with the paperclip. The penny got a scratch.
EM.33b.452.1  A paperclip is harder than a penny.
EM.33b.466.1  If the paperclip scratches it then the penny scratches it because they are almost the same hardness.
EM.33b.467.1  Because the penny is the middle hardness and the paperclip is the hardest that is how one knows it should scratched.
EM.33b.488.1  Because if mineral is kind of hard as a penny.
EM.33b.492.1  If the hardest tool can scratch the mineral then the second hardest can.
EM.33b.504.1  If a washer scratched the mineral and the paperclip is harder than the washer than it would scratch the mineral too.
EM.33b.523.1  A paperclip is the hardest so if a penny can a paperclip can.
EM.33b.561.1  A paperclip is also hard and it can make a mark.
EM.33b.570.1  Because paperclip is bigger and harder.
EM.33b.573.1  Because paperclip is harder and it can not scratch the mineral.
EM.33b.593.1  Because a penny is a little bit harder than a fingernail and if a penny scratches a fingernail would scratch.
ME.36.108.1  The bulbs are dim because they have to share a path. They are bright because they do not have to share a pathway.
ME.36.123.1  Because with a parallel the bulbs have their own pathway.
ME.36.146.1  In a series the bulbs do not have enough energy to flow through it. In a parallel the bulbs has a enough out energy to flow through.
ME.36.173.1  The bulbs are dim on the series circuit because the series circuit does not have a circuit. The parallel is bright because the bulbs have a circuit.
ME.36.181.1  The bulbs are very bright because they each have their own pathway.
ME.36.185.1  In the series circuit there is a disconnection in the wiring. In a parallel circuit the energy flows straight to the bulb , goes through and keeps going in a circuit.
ME.36.206.1  The light bulbs are dim because in a series circuit they share some of the same connections.
ME.36.214.1  The bulbs are dim in a series because they are using each other 's energy , the lights are bright in a parallel because the bulbs are not sharing energy with each other.
ME.36.215.1  One gets more power than the other.
ME.36.226.1  The bulbs are dim in a series and bright in a parallel because parallel is 2 or more and a series is only one way. So parallel is stronger.
ME.36.253.1  The bulbs are dim in series and bright in parallel because the 2 bulbs were new and the other bulbs were probably old.
ME.36.277.1  The lights are dim in a series circuit because they share the same circuit , and bright in a parallel circuit because they do not share.
ME.36.278.1  The bulbs are dim in a series circuit because one of the bulbs is taking all of the electricity. The bulbs are bright in the parallel circuit because they are sharing electricity.
SE.27b.103.1  No , There are 2 different things.
SE.27b.105.1  No , Because the bulb would be little warm. It would be hotter if the student would not be grabbing the bulb.
SE.27b.120.1  No , the thermometer would not read the same temperature because the heat on oner hand heats the thermometer.
SE.27b.133.1  No , No because the temperature will rise like 4 or 5 degrees.
SE.27b.139.1  No , The temperature will change when one holds the thermometer by the bulb because oner hand and body is warm so the temperature will go high.
SE.27b.184.1  Yes , I think yes because if one puts oner thumb there the heat from oner body makes onerself heat in oner own body.
SE.27b.243.1  No , Because of that student 's body heat.
SE.27b.265.1  Yes , Well the alcohol needs the sun or shade to change the bulb of the thermometer , but if something or someone is blocking it , the alcohol will not go neither up nor down.
SE.27b.316.1  No , Because if a student had the thermometer by the bulb the thermometer would measure the temperature of his or her body not the object.
SE.27b.323.1  No , Because the thermometer would read how cold or hot is the bulb and that is what it would read.
SE.27b.333.1  Yes , Because if one put oner hand on the round part the air is not going to feel thermometer.
SE.27b.416.1  No , if a person held a thermometer by the bulb then the thermometer would sense oner hands and the degrees would rise.
SE.27b.514.1  No , the temperature would not be the same because the thermometer would be taking in the body temperature.
SE.27b.538.1  No , the temperature would be warmer because the warmth and pressure of oner fingers would give warmth to the bulb.
SE.27b.605.1  No , No because the temperature would be changed.
WA.18.469.1  A person agrees because heat can help the time of evaporation.
WA.22.207.1  One chooses both evaporation and condensation because when water evaporates it turns into water vapor when there is enough it forms rain clouds then condensation happens and forms rain.
WA.22.212.1  Was evaporation makes a cloud full of water vapor then that cloud becomes rain.
WA.22.221.1  Because but evaporation is air condensation is like cloud and rain.
WA.22.223.1  Because evaporation causes the water to go up in the air, and condensation makes clouds which eventually form precipitation or rain.
WA.22.227.1  Because water gets evaporated.
WA.22.229.1  Evaporation and condensation both have something to do with rain because evaporation evaporates the water into the air and makes it water vapor. The water vapor condenses and makes clouds filled with water and then the cloud touches a cool surface and condensation makes the liquid water back into water and it rains.
WA.21.461.1  Ice expands instead of contracts.
WA.21.522.1  The bottle gets so cold and froze that it cracked the plastic bottle.
WA.21.523.1  Because the water in the water bottle froze and it expanded and it did not have enough room, so it cracked.
WA.21.534.1  The bottle cracked because water expands when the temperature hits the freezing point.
MX.16a.389.1  Yes because the saturated solutions both have the same amount of solid.
FN.19b.103.1  Putting the bag of yeast, warm whatever the food sample one are tasting.
FN.19b.106.1  Whichever food has the most carbohydrates has more sugar. And that is how a person will know her results.
FN.19b.139.1  Finally a person will have to get a volume tube put the bag in it and press down. Then one are done.
FN.19b.145.1  A person will know which food contains the most sugar by how high the volume tube goes. Look at the one with the highest number or highest volume tube.
WA.18.383.1  Water evaporation is also predicted by the volume mass.
WA.18.385.1  A person disagrees because the surface area effects the evaporation. Also it just takes more time when the water is cold.
WA.18.451.1  A person agrees because anything with water on it in the heat will evaporate.
WA.18.455.1  A person disagrees because water can evaporate when it is breezy too.
WA.18.456.1  A person disagrees because water can evaporate at any temperature.
WA.18.465.1  A person disagrees. Water can evaporate at any temperature. Make the water make it evaporate faster.
LP.15c.105.1  The seed and root both relate because one equals the other for a answer.
LP.15c.112.1  The distance of the effort required to lift the load from the fulcrum is 15 centimeters.
LF.13b.773.1  Erosion is the process of moving sediment from one place to another.
LF.13b.918.1  What happens earth materials during erosion is the materials are carried away form water that tables 9 to another place.
SE.44.123.1  The advantage is that when one is including a heat sink it takes up some space.
SE.44.126.1  The advantage is the water and rocks would not probably warm up the house that much.
SE.44.419.1  The advantage is that the heat sink keeps oner house warm.
SE.44.427.1  The advantage of including a heat sink in our solar houses would be that it would keep the heat in one place and release it slower.
SE.44.436.1  The advantage of having a heat sink in oner house is that the heat slowly rises.
SE.44.494.1  The advantage of including a heat sink in a house would be that the house would probably stay warm.
SE.44.563.1  The advantage is that a heat sink can absorb the heat and energy !
HB.6a.249.1  The main job of muscles is to allow you to move and bend.
HB.6a.251.1  The main job of muscles is to work together with the bones.
WA.16b.526.1  Because the water in the thermometer is room temperature water and hot water is less dense than room temperature water causing it to float or rise.
EV.11.428.1  The optimum condition is the best and range of tolerance is what it survive in, optimum condition equals thrive, range of tolerance equals survive.
SE.4a.123.1  A heat sink is an object that can attract heat.
SE.4a.126.1  Heat sink is anything that gets or contains heat.
SE.4a.159.1  A heat sink is something that traps heat in. Like water it heats up and traps the heat to make boiling water.
SE.4a.190.1  A heat sink is when the temperature in the thermometer goes down or decreases.
SE.4a.191.1  A heat sink is something that absorbs heat and loses heat slow like water.
SE.4a.316.1  A heat sink is an earth material that absorbs energy slowly and releases it slowly.
SE.4a.382.1  A heat sink is a material that decreases heat such as water.
SE.4a.409.1  A heat sink is something that absorbs sunlight quickly. Water is the best heat sink.
SE.4a.429.1  A heat sink is when the temperature drops.
SE.4a.441.1  A heat sink is when a temperature goes up just a little or down a little.
SE.4a.493.1  A heat sink is a substance that can take in and give off heat.
SE.4a.564.1  A heat sink is a material that slows down another.
SE.4a.598.1  A heat sink is something takes long to cool down and get hot.
SE.4a.602.1  A heat sink is something that takes water to absorb.
SE.4a.605.1  A heat sink is not a thing like water.
SE.4a.620.1  A heat sink is water because it absorbs slowly and it lets go slowly.
MX.16a.386.1  No, because there is less room for the solute to spread out in the person's solution. The material at the bottom is not part of the solution.
EM.13.508.1  Minerals are in rocks. The rocks are minerals put together.
EM.13.537.1  Mineral is something in a rock a rock is a hard cement kind of.
EM.33b.427.1  Because the paperclip is an easier item to scratch a rock or mineral than a penny.
EM.33b.499.1  A paperclip is harder than a penny and the paperclip is like a penny.
EM.33b.609.1  Because the paperclip is the hardest tool and the penny is almost the hardest so the paperclip can scratch the mineral.
ME.36.313.1  In the series circuit the bulbs are dim because there is only one bulb. In the parallel circuit there are 2 bulbs so the bulbs are bright.
ME.36.328.1  The bulbs in a series circuit are dim because there is only one pathway for electricity and in a parallel circuit there is more than one pathway.
WA.22.182.1  Both evaporation and condensation are processes that involve causing rain because first, when there is a cup of water, the sun would evaporate the water and turn it into water vapor, then the water vapor would touch a cool surface and start condensation. Then the condensation would go to the clouds and cause rain.
WA.21.497.1  Because 0 degrees Celsius is the freezing point of water. When water freezes it expands. The water bottle cracked because the ice needed more room than the water.
WA.21.510.1  0 degrees Celsius is 32 degrees Fahrenheit and when the temperature is 32 degrees Fahrenheit the water froze and when water freezes the ice expands.
WA.21.521.1  Because if one leaves a cup or bottle of water outside when the temperature is 0 degrees Celsius it will crack.
