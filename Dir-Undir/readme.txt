1. we categorized the student answers into two groups: one group is comprised of student answers in which the directionality information in their respective answer graphs is of utmost importance for better understanding (Group-dir) and the other group is comprised of student answers where the directionality information is not vital (Group-nodir).

2. The performance of the proposed directed FA model and System-I are evaluated for each of the groups by running the code evaluation-gaps.py to obtain results for the proposed FA models and System-I.
