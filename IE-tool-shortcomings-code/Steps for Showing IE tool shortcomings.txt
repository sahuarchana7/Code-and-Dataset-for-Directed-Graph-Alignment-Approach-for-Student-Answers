# Steps for Showing IE tool shortcomings

1. Take a randomly selected set of Student answers - Model answers from the SciEntsBank dataset (this dataset is taken for illustration purpose).

2. Run the original code for determining gaps in student answers....do this for the entire dataset. These are gaps obtained using the old triples directly extracted for a pair of student answer-model answer by CLAUSIE tool. Compute the gap detection model performance metrics. 

3. Now, to understand the difference in quality of gaps extracted in student answer using triples automatically extracted using IE tool and manually extracted triples for a pair of answers, first obtain the automatically extracted IE triples for both student answer and model answer. Based on your visual observation and understanding, modify the triples such that they appear more meaningful. 

4. Using these manually extracted / constructed triples for each pair of answers in the randomly selected dataset, identify the gaps in student answer and also compute the evaluation metrics indicating model performance using manually extracted triples. 

5. It is observed that comparatively better gap detection results are obtained using the manually extracted triples.
