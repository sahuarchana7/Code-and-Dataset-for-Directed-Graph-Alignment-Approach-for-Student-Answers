JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The youngest son of ex-dictator Suharto disobeyed a summons to surrender himself to prosecutors Monday and be imprisoned for corruption. 
Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala Putra, 37, was sentenced to 18 months in prison on Sept. 22 by the Supreme Court, which overturned an earlier acquittal by a lower court.
