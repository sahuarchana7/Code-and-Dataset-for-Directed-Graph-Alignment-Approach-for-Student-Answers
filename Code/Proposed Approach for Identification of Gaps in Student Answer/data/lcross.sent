The Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) was a robotic spacecraft operated by NASA.
It was launched together with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) on June 18, 2009, as part of the shared Lunar Precursor Robotic Program, the first American mission to the Moon in over ten years.
LCROSS was designed to watch as the launch vehicle's spent Centaur upper stage, with a nominal impact mass of 2,305 kg (5,081 lb), struck the Cabeus crater[3] near the south pole of the Moon.
