S1 	Jerusalem 7-15 -LRB- AFP -RRB- - A high level Israeli army official has said today Saturday that Israel believes Iran is set to begin acquiring nuclear capability for military purposes from 2005 and will be in a position to equip missiles with nuclear warheads , capable of reaching Israel , within ten years .
S2 	The official , who wished to remain anonymous , told journalists : `` Iran will start accumulating nuclear capability for military purposes from 2005 and will be in a position , within the space of 10 years , to produce nuclear warheads that can be fitted to missiles capable of striking Israel . ''
S3 	The official made these statements after Tehran announced today Saturday that it had `` successfully '' completed a new test on the Shahab 3 ground-ground missile with a range of 1300 kilometers .
S4 	The official further said : `` Iran is not capable of developing a nuclear program without Moscow 's help . ''
S5 	He said that according to information obtained by Israel , tests on the Shahab 3 ground-ground missile were in fact `` successful and reached their maximum range of 1300 kilometers which allows them to reach strategic centers in Israel . ''
S6 	The official said that the design of the Shahab missile is based on a North Korean missile called Nodong , itself developed from the Soviet Scud missile .
S7 	The official also stressed that Iran regards the `` destruction of Israel as legitimate , '' saying that `` Tehran is embroiled in strategic terrorist activities targeting Israel , especially alongside Palestinian and Lebanese organizations . ''
S8 	The official further considered that `` the Shahab missile will not come into operation for two years and that an improved range of 2000 kilometers would only be achieved after this period . ''
S9 	Israel 's Deputy Defense Minister , Ephraim Sneh , said today Saturday that Israel would `` know how to find a suitable response '' to the Iranian Shahab 3 ground-ground missile with a 1300 kilometer range .
S10	Sneh said on army radio that `` Israel will prepare itself to find a suitable response to this threat , '' without giving any further details .
S11	The Iranian army announced today Saturday that it had `` successfully '' completed a new test on Shahab 3 ground-ground missiles .
S12	An official at the Iranian Ministry of Defense told Tehran Radio that the `` Shahab 3 defense missile was tested a second time to ensure it conforms to international standards . ''
S13	In July 1998 , the first test on this missile was announced .
S14	It is capable of reaching the majority of countries in the region , including Israel .

S1 	Beirut 8-15 -LRB- AFP -RRB- - Lebanon has asked the international peacekeeping force operating in the south to investigate reports indicating that Israel is penetrating the shared border between the two countries and to prevent this from happening .
S2 	According to official sources , the Lebanese authorities contacted the peacekeeping high command and asked it to put an end to infringements by Israel , which is carrying out operations inside Lebanese territory , in particular dumping sand and building slopes .
S3 	The source added that if this is confirmed , then such acts constitute a provocation and an infringement of Lebanese sovereignty .
S4 	Witnesses said two Israeli bulldozers started work today Tuesday on a slope in the Abbad sector inside Lebanese territory on the border between Lebanon and Israel .
S5 	These witnesses told Agence France Presse that an Israeli army patrol equipped with ultra-modern binoculars penetrated a few meters into Lebanese territory but withdrew back to Israeli territory as soon as a peacekeeping patrol arrived .
S6 	Families in southern Lebanon visit this area where , according to tradition , the burial site of Sheikh Abbad , who died 500 years ago , is located .
S7 	For their part , Israelis also regard the site as a shrine because , according to them , Rabbi Ashi lived there in the 5th century .
S8 	The Israeli army had previously carried out operations inside Lebanese territory in the same border region on August 11 .
S9 	Last Friday , an Israeli bulldozer crossed the wire fence in Wadi Marjayoun near the Israeli village of Matla and spread sand over a length of hundreds of meters and a width of six meters in order to expose the footprints of people crossing the border or tire prints of cars from the Lebanese side .

S1 	Beirut 10-15 -LRB- AFP -RRB- - The Saudi Soccer Federation sacked the team 's Czech coach Milan Machala from his post today Sunday and appointed his assistant , Nasser Jawhar , in his place .
S2 	The title-holding Saudi team suffered a bitter defeat -LRB- 1-4 -RRB- against its Japanese counterpart in its first match in the championship yesterday Saturday .
S3 	The Youth and Sports Bureau in Saudi Arabia released a statement saying : `` Prince Sultan Ben Fahd , president of the Youth and Sports Bureau and president of the Saudi Soccer Federation , has issued a decision by order of which Czech coach Machala has been discharged and Nasser Jawhar has been placed in charge of training the team during the championship . ''
S4 	He carried on : `` This decision is the result of the Saudi Federation ensuring the best technical conditions for the team in order to reflect the true level of Saudi soccer . ''
S5 	In a telephone call with Agence France Presse at his hotel , Machala refused to give his opinion regarding the decision and said `` no comment . ''

S1 	Bandar Seri Begawan 11-15 -LRB- AFP -RRB- - American President Bill Clinton attempted today Wednesday to reassure money markets about doubts caused by the battle between the Republicans and Democrats on the result of the presidential elections in the United States , which is still unknown and dependent on the results of the recount in the State of Florida .
S2 	Clinton told a group of businessmen on the periphery of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Brunei that `` one of the issues both Vice-President Al Gore and Governor George Bush agree on in these elections is the need to maintain a strong and pioneering role by the United States in order to achieve flourishing trade and greater integration for the world 's economy -LRB- ... -RRB- and the world should not be concerned because the two candidates are strongly committed to following this path . ''
S3 	The American stock market saw an upheaval as a result of the delay in announcing the final results of the presidential elections in the United States but it improved on Tuesday .
S4 	Initial results in Florida on Tuesday evening showed Republican candidate George Bush to be 300 votes ahead of Democrat candidate Al Gore but some voting stations were still recounting votes today Wednesday .
S5 	In Brunei , President Clinton refused to make any predications about who might win the presidency in this exceptional election battle between the Democratic and Republican candidates .
S6 	He said `` we must be careful when we talk about predictions ; the only thing I can predict with confidence is that I will not be taking part in the next Apec summit next year and at present , I ca n't say who will be representing the United States . ''

S1 	Bandar Seri Begawan 11-15 -LRB- AFP -RRB- - A high-level American official announced today Wednesday in the wake of the meeting between American President Bill Clinton and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that Putin 's proposals on reducing the Russian and American nuclear capability to under 1500 nuclear heads does not include `` many new elements . ''
S2 	The official who wished to remain anonymous confirmed `` we have paid a great deal of attention to President Putin 's announcement but it does not contain many new elements , in fact just a few new disparities which require further examination and discussion by experts . ''
S3 	Clinton and Putin are taking part in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation -LRB- APEC -RRB- forum in Bandar Seri Begawan the capital of the Sultanate of Brunei .
S4 	The presidents met for a working lunch of around 75 minutes .
S5 	The American official stressed that what is important in Putin 's proposal is that it falls within the `` framework adopted by the United States and Russia to discuss strategic issues from a defensive and offensive point of view . ''
S6 	Putin proposed limiting the Russian and American nuclear capabilities by reducing the number of nuclear heads to under 1500 each , a smaller number than that in the Russian-American Start-3 treaty currently being negotiated .
S7 	He proposed that the current reduction should be between 2500 to 2000 nuclear heads .
S8 	Putin said this reduction would depend on compliance with the Russian-American anti-ABM missile treaty signed in 1972 , which the Americans are attempting to amend to set up anti- missile defenses -LRB- NMD -RRB- .
S9 	Washington has so far confirmed agreeing to the 2000 to 2500 nuclear warhead ceiling .
S10	The United States has not taken a final position on the NMD system because Clinton , whose term ends in January , is leaving the decision in this matter to his successor .
S11	In response to a question about Republican presidential candidate George Bush Junior 's approach to deploying the NMD system , more ambitious than the one proposed by the Clinton administration , the American official said the United States would continue `` complying with the present framework '' in these strategic discussions .
S12	He added `` while this framework does not reflect the basic interests of the United States , we feel it is still a valid approach in our discussions with Russia on this matter . ''
S13	He also said that Clinton raised the issue of the transfer of sensitive Russian technology to Iran , adding `` President Putin has expressed his agreement that these are real threats and is strongly committed to limiting this , but there is still a lot of work to do '' in this area .
S14	Clinton also touched on the matter of American Edmond Bob who is being tried in a closed court in Russia on charges of spying .
S15	The United States believes he is innocent of these charges and is demanding his release on humanitarian grounds .
S16	The official said Putin understands our concern and we hope he will do something as quickly as possible . ''

S1 	Camp Zeist -LRB- Holland -RRB- 11-15 -LRB- AFP -RRB- - Today Wednesday , the judges in charge of looking into the Lockerbie case in Camp Zeist -LRB- Holland -RRB- were faced with an awkward problem : how to deal with a witness who is refusing to answer questions and who is at the same time serving a life sentence and who is not subject to Scottish law ?
S2 	The problem arose after Palestinian Mahmood Abu Talib , whose testimony the court has been hearing since Friday , refused to continue answering a question by defense lawyer Richard Keen about the detailed reasons for his having lived in the former Soviet Union for a period of 18 months in the 70s .
S3 	The lawyer asked the judges to force Abu Talib to answer the question aimed at demonstrating the witness 's `` professional terrorism '' precedents .
S4 	46-year-old Abu Talib was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1990 in Sweden for terrorist acts in Amsterdam , Copenhagen and Stockholm between 1985 and 1986 .
S5 	The defense council in the Lockerbie court is attempting to show his involvement in the Lockerbie attack .
S6 	Based on Scottish law , followed in this court , if Abu Talib insists on not responding to the question , this is considered to be `` contempt of court '' and means he may be punished in accordance with Scottish law covering such incidents .
S7 	The problem is that the judges may not punish Abu Talib unless Sweden hands him over to Scotland after the court case ends to apply the punishment for `` contempt of court . ''
S8 	So far , the judges have not asked Abu Talib to answer the defense 's question in what appears to be a move to avoid a tricky situation if the witness refuses to answer .
S9 	The court president , Ronald Sutherland , who adjourned the session for a short while in an attempt to find a solution to this dilemma , said `` this raises an important question of principle . ''
S10	The two Libyans , Alameen Khalifa Fahima and Abdulbasit al-Maqrahi , are suspected of sending a bomb from Malta which was used to explode the Pan Am plane over the Scottish village of Lockerbie on December 21 , 1988 killing 270 people .

S1 	CAIRO , Egypt -LRB- AP -RRB- _ In his foreign policy debut as Syria 's president , Bashar Assad met Sunday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in talks on Mideast peace and the escalating violence in the Palestinian territories .
S2 	Assad , on his first trip abroad since becoming president in July , also dealt with the issue of Iraq in the talks with Mubarak , Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa said .
S3 	The Syrian leader 's visit came on a fourth day of clashes that have raged in the West Bank , Gaza Strip and Jerusalem , leaving more than two dozen Palestinians dead .
S4 	`` There is complete agreement -LRB- between Mubarak and Assad -RRB- as to the seriousness of the situation and that the negative repercussions would adversely effect the peace process , which is in itself in a very precarious state , '' Moussa said .
S5 	Assad , 35 , has focused on domestic issues since his father , Hafez Assad , died in June after 30 years in power .
S6 	He has taken steps to modernize his nation 's bureaucracy and revive its stagnant economy .
S7 	`` This was the first meeting of the first visit of President Bashar Assad after the funeral of his father , so it was only normal for the discussions to have a general tone ... in addition to certain specifics of special importance to both countries and the Arab world , '' Moussa said .
S8 	The late Syrian president rarely traveled abroad .
S9 	In his last few years , however , he had sent Bashar , educated as an eye doctor , on foreign trips as part of his grooming to become president .
S10	Prospects appear dim for progress on either the Syrian or Palestinian peace track .
S11	The deadlock in Palestinian-Israeli talks is exacerbated by the worst violence in four years .
S12	Syria 's government-run media said last week that no progress could be expected now because of the U.S. elections and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak 's precarious situation as leader of a minority government .
S13	Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations broke down in January , with Syria demanding a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights , a strategic plateau captured by Israel in 1967 .
S14	Israel insists on waiting to settle borders until it knows what it will gain by returning Golan land .
S15	Assad has made it clear he intends to follow his father 's course in any negotiations with Israel .
S16	Mubarak and Assad met after a week when Russia , France , Jordan and Yemen sent planes to Baghdad , challenging U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait .
S17	Iraq is hoping other Arab countries will follow , despite U.S. complaints , easing its isolation .
S18	Moussa said the presidents discussed the situation in Iraq and would return to it Monday .
S19	However , he would not comment on whether Syria and Egypt were planning to send planes to Baghdad .
S20	Egypt and Syria are on good terms , but they have had their differences .
S21	Hafez Assad 's attempts to rally Arab leaders to present a unified front against Israel gained little ground .
S22	He derided Egypt for signing a peace treaty with Israel in 1979 .

S1 	JAKARTA , Indonesia -LRB- AP -RRB- _ The youngest son of ex-dictator Suharto disobeyed a summons to surrender himself to prosecutors Monday and be imprisoned for corruption .
S2 	Hutomo `` Tommy '' Mandala Putra , 37 , was sentenced to 18 months in prison on Sept. 22 by the Supreme Court , which overturned an earlier acquittal by a lower court .
S3 	It found him guilty of enriching himself through a property deal with the state 's main food supply agency .
S4 	Prosecutors said the 1997 deal , made when his father was still in power , had cost the Indonesian state $ 10.8 million .
S5 	Tommy , a multimillionaire with a playboy image and love of fast cars , is the first member of Suharto 's family to be convicted of graft .
S6 	Because the Supreme Court 's decision to imprison Tommy did not come into immediate effect , prosecutors served a summons on Tommy to be taken into custody Monday .
S7 	He instead sent a legal team to discuss whether he would appeal the ruling or admit his guilt and seek a presidential pardon .
S8 	The delay of Tommy 's arrest comes just days after another court dismissed other corruption charges against his 79-year-old father on grounds of ill health , enraging pro-democracy activists and triggering violent demonstrations .
S9 	Critics of Indonesia 's legal system have accused it of going soft on the Suharto clan .
S10	A co-defendant in Tommy 's case , businessman Riccardo Gelael , separately admitted his guilt Monday to prosecutors and said he would appeal to President Abdurrahman Wahid for a pardon .
S11	Antasari Ashar , chief of South Jakarta Prosecution Office , said Tommy would again be summoned to meet prosecutors on Wednesday .
S12	If Tommy opts for a judicial review of the case , his fate will be decided by the same court that last week dismissed graft charges against his father .
S13	The decision to let Suharto off triggered fierce street demonstrations , in which one man died and dozens were injured .
S14	For weeks Suharto 's trial had been marred by a series of bombings in Jakarta , including a blast at the city 's stock exchange building in which 15 people were killed .
S15	Many suspect supporters of Suharto , who ruled for 32 years until his ouster in 1998 , were behind the attacks .

S1 	NEW YORK -LRB- AP -RRB- _ The price of a college degree continues to rise faster than inflation , with tuition and fees at public four-year colleges up an average 4.4 percent this fall , even more at private schools , a new survey has found .
S2 	And loans provide a growing chunk of the extra money students need to pay for those degrees .
S3 	Average in-state tuition and fees at public , four-year schools is $ 3,510 per semester _ $ 148 more than last year , according to figures released Monday by the College Board .
S4 	On-campus room and board now averages $ 4,960 , up 5.1 percent .
S5 	At private four-year colleges , tuition and fees average $ 16,332 , up 5.2 percent from last year .
S6 	Room and board on campus is now $ 6,209 , a 4.2 percent increase .
S7 	Only public two-year schools , chiefly community colleges , stayed below the current inflation rate _ but barely .
S8 	Tuition rose this year to $ 1,705 , up 3.4 percent , the survey found .
S9 	Private two-year schools boosted tuition and fees to $ 7,458 , a 7 percent rise .
S10	This pattern follows an old , familiar trend , said Joni Finney , a policy analyst at the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education in San Jose , Calif. `` Colleges and universities have a very difficult time controlling their costs , '' she said .
S11	`` These institutions were underfunded in the early part of the '90s , '' Finney said .
S12	'' ... But they 've more than made up for lost ground . ''
S13	But Stanley Eikenberry , president of the American Council on Education , an umbrella group for higher education , said in a statement , `` Given the large , fixed costs of most campuses , in personnel and facilities especially , these numbers show institutions are working hard to hold the line on increases . ''
S14	The recent increases push past inflation .
S15	The Consumer Price Index rose 2.7 percent in 1999 ; the first eight months of this year , consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 3.5 percent .
S16	Last year , college tuition and fees rose less than 5 percent .
S17	Despite the increases , college remains affordable and a good investment , said College Board President Gaston Caperton in a statement with the surveys .
S18	`` In both earning potential and learning potential , you can not beat the value of a college education , '' the former West Virginia governor said .
S19	The College Board 's figures concern the costs for 6.4 million full-time undergraduates _ 54 percent attending four-year public institutions , 27 percent at four-year private schools , 17 percent at two-year community colleges and 1 percent at private two-year schools .
S20	A majority of students need grants or loans _ or both _ but their exact numbers are unknown , a College Board spokesman said .
S21	Last school year , loans made up 59 percent of a record $ 68 billion in financial aid .
S22	A decade ago , loans made up just over 41 percent of student financial help .
S23	The pool of money from federal , state and school sources last year was 4 percent greater than a year earlier , but 88 percent more than a decade before , taking inflation into account .
S24	The New York-based College Board is a nonprofit organization that administers the SATs and promotes higher education .
S25	It surveyed more than 3,000 schools to find out undergraduate charges for 2000-2001 .
S26	The companion survey on financial aid , was based on federal , state and school statistics from 1999-2000 .
S27	Current grant and loan figures are not available until the school year ends .

S1 	ST. LOUIS -LRB- AP -RRB- _ As Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore prepared to perch on stools and take voters ' questions in a crucial third debate , the sudden death of Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan cast a pall over their final meeting .
S2 	After talk of cancellation or a postponement for mourning , plans were made early Tuesday to continue the 9 p.m. EDT event on schedule , officials of both campaigns said .
S3 	`` In the end , there was general agreement that Mel Carnahan would have wanted us to go forward , '' a senior Bush campaign official said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
S4 	Bush 's wife , Laura , canceled plans for a morning rally .
S5 	Bush campaign officials also decided to tone down a post-debate rally , and were even considering canceling it .
S6 	Gore had n't planned any events before the debate .
S7 	Carnahan , a Democrat who was running for the Senate , campaigned with Gore whenever the vice president was in Missouri and would have accompanied Gore aboard Air Force II to a Kansas City rally on Wednesday .
S8 	Gore called Mrs. Carnahan with his condolences after the news broke Monday night , aides said .
S9 	`` We 're all waking up , honestly , to the tragedy and the pain of it and the shock of it , '' Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman said Tuesday morning on CNN .
S10	The Bush and Gore campaigns did not talk to each other directly about the possibility of postponement , but went through the debate commission 's director , Janet Brown , in a series of pre-dawn phone calls .
S11	Eventually , Brown recommended that the debate should go on , and neither side objected , according to campaign officials .
S12	The commission was to announce the plans later Tuesday , with each candidate given time at the debate 's start to say a few words about Carnahan , who died Monday night in the crash of a small plane .
S13	With the larger bloc of uncommitted voters across the nation apparently holding the key to the election , both candidates were clearly mindful of the high stakes if the encounter goes forward as planned .
S14	The informal question-and-answer format is one Gore is comfortable with , and he promised on Monday to `` just have an open meeting , '' as he had done many times before .
S15	Bush , who has less formal debate experience than the vice president but whose standing in public opinion polls rose after the first two face-offs , vowed to `` just tell it like it is . ''
S16	The debate , just three weeks before the Nov. 7 election , will be held on the campus of Washington University .
S17	While the moderator will be the same as in the Boston and Winston-Salem , N.C. , debates _ Jim Lehrer of PBS _ questions this time will come from the audience .
S18	The Gallup polling organization , assigned by the Commission on Presidential Debates to recruit questioners , started with a random sample of all registered voters in St. Louis and its suburbs , and then screened out all but `` uncommitted voters , '' said Frank Newport , Gallup 's executive editor .
S19	The result was a group of area voters who say they could support either Gore or Bush _ though they might be leaning one way or the other .
S20	The theater-in-the-round stage will be informally set with two stools and surrounded by 100 questioners and an additional 500 onlookers .
S21	Tuesday night 's debate marks the beginning of the final stretch .
S22	And , with polls continuing to show the race to be neck-and-neck , any stumble could have major impact on a contest in which both candidates are fiercely wooing a dwindling band of undecided voters .
S23	Gore held a mock debate on Monday , inviting 23 voters to the Innsbrook resort outside St. Louis to help him practice .
S24	`` I 'm going to do what I 've done a lot of times in Tennessee , and that is , just have an open meeting , '' Gore said .
S25	In 16 years in Congress , Gore held some 1,000 town meetings with Tennessee constituents , and they 've become a regular feature of his presidential campaign .
S26	After an uncharacteristically muted demeanor in last week 's debate , Gore , was looking to do better this time .
S27	`` I do n't think you play it safe , '' said Gore 's campaign chairman , William Daley , previewing the Tuesday night encounter .
S28	`` I think you try to be very natural and lay out in a forward way the compelling reasons for the election to go your way . ''
S29	Bush had long resisted the town-hall-style session , but in recent weeks on the campaign trail has been doing them almost daily .
S30	`` I 've felt comfortable about it , '' the Republican said Monday .

S1 	ARLINGTON , Texas -LRB- AP -RRB- _ One of baseball 's biggest free-agent prizes , Alex Rodriguez is getting red-carpet treatment from the Texas Rangers .
S2 	And even the Dallas Stars are lending a hand in trying to win over the All-Star shortstop .
S3 	Rodriguez and agent Scott Boras were expected to meet Monday with Rangers owner Tom Hicks .
S4 	He will be joined by general manager Doug Melvin , manager Johnny Oates and several players .
S5 	The team 's bid for Rodriguez has n't been slowed by the expected demand of at least a 10-year contract , in the range of $ 20 million a year , loaded with fringe benefits .
S6 	`` We feel at the expense of last year , we have our roster where we do n't have to trade people to make this work , '' Melvin said in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram on Monday .
S7 	`` I 'm not saying we have all the money in the world , but we do n't have to bust our budget completely .
S8 	We 're in a better position than most other clubs . ''
S9 	Stars center Mike Modano is being called in to help show Rodriguez around the Dallas-Fort Worth area and tell him why it would be a great place to play .
S10	Melvin said he does n't expect the Rangers to make a formal offer until they can gauge the level of interest from Rodriguez .
S11	The 25-year-old shortstop , who hit .316 with 41 homers and 132 RBIs at Seattle last season , also reportedly has been targeted by the Chicago White Sox , Los Angeles Dodgers , New York Mets and Atlanta Braves .
S12	The Mariners , Rodriguez 's team the past six years , also wanted to re-sign him .
S13	`` This gives us a chance to tell him about our organization and the direction we 're going , answer any questions they might have about us , '' Melvin said .
S14	Some even have a neighborhood _ the fashionable Dallas suburb of Highland Park _ picked out for Rodriguez .
S15	Neighbors of one available residence _ a five-bedroom spread worth $ 11.95 million _ would include Hicks , Modano and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones .
S16	`` Alex needs to buy this house , '' Ronda Needham , a listing agent , told The Dallas Morning News .
S17	`` The people who own this house set it up around their two baseball-playing sons .
S18	It 's a very sports-minded house . ''
S19	The Mets , once considered the favorites to get Rodriguez , have slowed their chase .
S20	General manager Steve Phillips publicly criticized some of the demands supposedly made by Boras .
S21	But the agent says Rodriguez is making no special demands .
S22	`` I ca n't anticipate any change that would draw us back into it , '' Phillips said .

S1 	LONDON -LRB- AP -RRB- _ After three defeats in the House of Lords , Britain 's Labor government resorted to rarely used powers Thursday to pass legislation lowering the age of consent for homosexuals from 18 to 16 .
S2 	House of Commons speaker Michael Martin said he was invoking the Parliament Act to force through a Sexual Offenses Bill that makes the age of consent the same for both homosexuals and heterosexuals .
S3 	It became law after being given Royal Assent by Queen Elizabeth II .
S4 	Lawmakers in the House of Commons overwhelmingly approved the bill earlier this year , but the House of Lords this month rejected it for the third time .
S5 	The Lords ' powers , however , are limited to delaying legislation by blocking it and bouncing it back to the House of Commons .
S6 	The Parliament Act was created to ensure that the will of the country 's elected lawmakers prevails .
S7 	The bill brings Britain in line with most other European Union nations .
S8 	`` It is a reform which , in my personal view , is long overdue and is only right for a country that has a history of reform and challenging prejudice , '' said Home Secretary Jack Straw , Britain 's top law enforcement officer .
S9 	`` This act will help us to build a safe , just and tolerant society , '' he added .
S10	Angela Mason , director of the gay rights group Stonewall , said Parliament 's action was `` a great step toward equality . ''
S11	`` When the history books come to be written I believe it will be seen as the moment when this country finally began to change , when lesbians and gay men started to take our place as equal members of society , '' she said .
S12	Peter Tatchell , of the group OutRage ! , said : `` This victory is a welcome and historic milestone in the long struggle for gay human rights . ''
S13	`` My only regret is that it has taken 33 years during which time hundreds of gay men have been unjustly jailed for victimless relationships . ''
S14	However , family values campaigner and Conservative ex-Leader of the Lords Baroness Young accused the government of behaving in a `` completely dictatorial manner '' toward Parliament .
S15	Straw dismissed the criticism .
S16	`` In the circumstances I believe that the use of the Parliament Act in this case is proper and justified , '' he said .
S17	Five years ago , Parliament narrowly rejected lowering the age of consent for homosexuals to 16 , reducing it instead from 21 to 18 .
S18	Homosexual sex between adults ceased to be a crime in Britain three decades ago .

S1 	PHOENIX -LRB- AP -RRB- _ Boise State coach Dirk Koetter , who just a day earlier was reportedly headed for Oklahoma State , has agreed to a contract to coach Arizona State .
S2 	Oklahoma State athletic director Terry Don Phillips confirmed Koetter 's decision in a news release issued Friday night .
S3 	`` Coach Koetter informed me at approximately 7 p.m. -LRB- CST -RRB- tonight that he had been tendered an offer from Arizona State University and had accepted , '' Phillips said .
S4 	Koetter , 41 , replaces Bruce Snyder , who was fired after nine seasons .
S5 	Snyder will coach Arizona State in a bowl game , most likely the Las Vegas Bowl .
S6 	The Daily Oklahoman and several TV and radio stations in Oklahoma had reported Thursday and Friday that Koetter had accepted the Oklahoma State job .
S7 	But Phillips never confirmed those reports , and Koetter would not comment on any job possibilities at Boise State 's practice Friday .
S8 	Koetter said earlier in the week he had interviewed with Phillips and with Arizona State athletic director Gene Smith .
S9 	Koetter is considered one of the country 's top young coaching prospects .
S10	Using an innovative , wide-open offense , he guided Boise State to a 25-10 record in three seasons .
S11	His first team went 6-5 , followed by last year 's 10-3 record , which included a 34-31 victory over Louisville in the Humanitarian Bowl .
S12	This year 's team is 9-2 , with its only losses 38-31 at Arkansas and 42-25 at Washington State .
S13	Koetter may not have been Arizona State 's top choice .
S14	Phoenix radio station KMVP reported Friday that Smith had quietly been working on a deal with TCU coach Dennis Franchione that would have matched the one offered by Alabama .
S15	But Franchione apparently could n't resist the lure of one of college football 's most storied programs .
S16	While most of the recent speculation centered on Koetter , there was pressure from some Arizona State boosters to hire Danny White , the former Arizona State and Dallas Cowboys quarterback who coaches the Arizona Rattlers of the Arena Football League .
S17	Snyder was fired after his teams went 6-6 last year and 6-5 this season .

S1 	WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS , W. Va. -LRB- AP -RRB- _ Republican Rep. J.C. Watts joked Saturday night that he had revised returns on the presidential election : `` Al Gore , 9,834 lawsuits .
S2 	George W. Bush , 7,652 . ''
S3 	Watts , chairman of the House Republican Conference , bantered about the Florida election dispute in a speech prepared for a dinner of The Gridiron Club at the Greenbrier Hotel .
S4 	`` I knew things had really deteriorated when Yasser Arafat offered to broker a peace between Bush and Gore , '' Watts said .
S5 	The Gridiron Club is an organization of 60 Washington journalists .
S6 	Its dinners feature parodies of politics and government , and humorous speeches by political figures .
S7 	Watts noted that the presidential election of 1876 was so disputed that a congressional commission was created to settle it .
S8 	`` I did n't know this until Strom Thurmond told me he cast the deciding vote .
S9 	`` Strom will be 98 next Tuesday , '' Watts said .
S10	`` Of course , he was only 67 when the recount of Florida ballots began . ''
S11	Watts said he had fond memories of Florida because he was the quarterback when the University of Oklahoma won the Orange Bowl there in 1980 and 1981 .
S12	`` But our victory in '81 was by a single point and it was weeks before it was confirmed , '' he said .
S13	`` By the way , I recently learned Al Gore was pulling for Florida State and demanded a recount . ''
S14	As is traditional in Gridiron speeches , Watts concluded on a serious note .
S15	`` Once-in-a-century oddities may leave an election result up in the air for a time , but the fundamental strength of our democracy is never in doubt , '' he said .
S16	`` Better a process driven by an army of lawyers than an outrage led by an army with guns , '' he said .

S1 	WASHINGTON -LRB- AP -RRB- _ Fossil remains of a 120 million-year-old bird with unique feathers cast doubt on the theory of birds evolving from dinosaurs , some experts say , but others disagree .
S2 	Two Chinese researchers report that a fossil called Protopteryx _ from a group of flying animals called Enantiornithine _ includes feathers that are `` different from those of all other known fossil and modern feathers . ''
S3 	Fucheng Zhang and Zhonghe Zhou of the Chinese Academy of Sciences suggest in the journal Science that the discovery supports the idea that feathers evolved from scales , like those found in reptiles .
S4 	The study was to be published Friday .
S5 	Some researchers who oppose the idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs embraced the new fossil as proof that birds and dinosaurs evolved independently from a common reptilian ancestor .
S6 	But others say Protopteryx adds nothing to the dino-bird debate .
S7 	`` There is nothing in the skeleton of this bird that disputes the dinosaur origin of birds , '' said Thomas R. Holtz Jr. , a University of Maryland paleobiologist and specialists on bird evolution .
S8 	`` The fact that this Protopteryx has these weird flat feathers really does n't affect that issue . ''
S9 	Alan Feduccia , an evolutionary biologist at the University of North Carolina , said the Chinese study of Protopteryx `` is a hot paper ... that directly contradicts the idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs . ''
S10	The new fossil was unveiled the day after researchers announced that another ancient Chinese bird , called Microraptor zhaoianus , supported the dinosaur origin of birds .
S11	In the study , Zhang and Zhou described the feather and bone structure found in a fossil of a starling-sized bird uncovered in northern China , the site of many dinosaur fossil finds .
S12	The Chinese researchers said the feathers have some of the characteristics of modern feathers , but the structure is more primitive than feathers found on Archaeopteryx , the earliest known bird .
S13	Archaeopteryx appeared about 145 million years ago , while Protopteryx was dated as more recent , about 120 million years ago .
S14	Microraptor , which was about the size of a crow , lived about 125 million years ago .
S15	Some elements of the Protopteryx wing bone and muscle structure match those of modern birds , said Zhang and Zhou , but the wing retains a claw found on some primitive birdlike animals .
S16	In modern birds , that claw has disappeared and been replaced with a structure that adds lift to the wing .
S17	Nonetheless , Protopteryx is thought to have been a competent flier .
S18	Most dinosaur researchers believe birds evolved 150 to 180 million years ago from a dinosaur group called Theropods .
S19	Researchers cite fundamental skeleton similarities to support the theory .
S20	The evolution of feathers , however , has been less clear .
S21	Some experts believe feathers evolved specifically to support flight , while others say feathers evolved first to provide warmth or protection from water .
S22	Fossils of three theropods bear hairlike images that some say could be the early precursors to feathers .
S23	But Feduccia dismisses the theropod hair as `` dino fuzz '' and cites the Zhang and Zhou paper as proof that feathers evolved from reptilian scales and that this could mean that birds evolved independent of dinosaurs .
S24	`` Bird feathers are very closely related to scales , '' said Feduccia .
S25	`` It is clear they evolved from elongated scales .
S26	Dino fuzz has nothing to do with feathers . ''
S27	Larry Martin , a University of Kansas paleontologist , said the Chinese researchers ' paper `` is the strongest evidence yet that bird feathers evolved for flight and that they were derived from scales . ''
S28	Holtz , however , notes that Protopteryx , with its primitive feathers , lived millions of years after Archaeopteryx , which had feathers almost identical to those of modern birds .
S29	`` This means the feathers on Protopteryx were probably an evolutionary reversal , '' said Holtz , adding that there are many examples where such reversals occur in nature .
S30	`` This just shows that feathers are extremely adaptable structures , '' he said .
S31	Michael Novacek , a dinosaur expert at the American Museum of Natural History in New York , says that the Zhang and Zhou study is `` ambiguous '' on the issue of dinosaurs and birds .
S32	`` The fact that you see a resemblance between scales and feathers does n't eliminate dinosaurs as close relatives to birds , '' said Novacek .
S33	He , too , said that evolution reversals are not rare .
S34	He said , for example , that whale ancestors lived on land and had fur , but evolution carried the huge mammals back to the sea .
S35	Holtz said the Zhang and Zhou study is important because it adds new understanding about the Enantiornithine , a bird group that dominated the latter part of the age of dinosaurs .
S36	`` The Enantiornithine got clobbered in the extinction event '' that killed off the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago , he said .
S37	This was followed by the dominance of another bird group , the Ornithurae , which later evolved into modern birds , said Holtz .

S1 	MOSCOW -LRB- AP -RRB- _ Russian lawmakers on Friday overwhelmingly approved the Soviet anthem as Russia 's national hymn _ a move praised by some as a gesture of reconciliation and denounced by others as a symbolic approval of the nation 's totalitarian past .
S2 	The State Duma , or lower house of parliament , voted 381-51 to approve the bill , which was strongly backed by President Vladimir Putin .
S3 	The move restored the old anthem 's music by composer Alexander Alexandrov but not the original text that included praise for Communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Josef Stalin .
S4 	By the same strong majority , the Duma approved legislation formally endorsing the country 's current white-red-and-blue flag as Russia 's official flag .
S5 	That legislation also brings back the Soviet-era red banner as the military 's flag and retains the Czarist double-headed eagle as the state emblem .
S6 	Putin has said the mixture of old Russian and Soviet symbols would mend bitter rifts in society by paying tribute to the positive heritage of both periods .
S7 	He referred to opinion polls showing that most people prefer Alexandrov 's music to a melody by 19th-century composer Mikhail Glinka , which has been Russia 's anthem since the 1991 Soviet collapse .
S8 	Liberal politicians and many leading cultural figures have strongly opposed the reinstatement of the Soviet anthem , saying it symbolized political repression .
S9 	`` We strongly protest against the Stalinist anthem , which is stained by the blood of millions of victims , '' said Grigory Yavlinsky , the head of the liberal Yabloko faction .
S10	Yabloko and another liberal faction , the Union of Right Forces , said they might appeal Friday 's vote in the Constitutional Court .
S11	The Duma usually hears speeches by faction leaders before a vote , but this time lawmakers skipped the debate _ a move the liberals described as a procedural violation .
S12	`` For the first time , the opposition was refused the right to speak out , '' Yavlinsky said .
S13	`` The presidential administration and Communists were afraid of our arguments against the Soviet anthem . ''
S14	Former President Boris Yeltsin has joined other critics of the move to restore the anthem .
S15	He said in an interview published Friday in the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda that the solemn music recalls Communist Party congresses , not Soviet sports victories and achievements in space , as Putin had said .
S16	`` I 'm categorically against the restoration of the Soviet anthem , '' Yeltsin said .
S17	Communists and other hard-liners had opposed the tricolor flag and the eagle as a vestige of the Czars , forcing Yeltsin to approve them by decree .
S18	But they agreed to abandon their criticism and back formal approval for the symbols in response to the reintroduction of the Soviet anthem .
S19	No conclusive version of new lyrics for the old music has been approved yet .
S20	The Duma asked Putin to set up a panel to consider the text and submit the final version for its approval .
S21	During Friday 's debate , Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said officials had received an anonymous telephone call saying a bomb had been planted in the building .
S22	Lawmakers ignored it and continued their session as police officers with sniffer dogs searched the premises .

S1 	DENVER -LRB- AP -RRB- _ The Denver Broncos and the NFL want a commercial real estate agent to take down a sign advertising a site for a potential sports bar because it features the team 's name .
S2 	John `` Jack '' Hanlon of Coldwell Banker American Spectrum is listing an acre of land about a mile from the Broncos ' training camp in Dove Valley .
S3 	Hanlon , a longtime Broncos fan , thinks it is the perfect place for a sports bar and has put up a blue-and-orange sign reading , `` Wanted Broncos Sports Bar On This Site . ''
S4 	He said that 47,000 cars drive by the site daily and `` because the players have to drive by it every day it could become a hangout for them . ''
S5 	Hanlon said he never has implied that the future sports bar would be called the Broncos Bar , but his company has turned over the matter to its legal department .
S6 	`` I thought it would be a good idea to have a bar that would celebrate the Broncos , emphasizing everything Broncos with pregame and postgame activities , '' Hanlon said .
S7 	`` But I could n't put that on a 4-by-8 sign . ''
S8 	He said he will do whatever his lawyer advises , but `` I do n't think the Broncos own the word ` Broncos . '' ' NFL lawyer David Proper has given Hanlon until Dec. 26 to remove the sign .
S9 	In a Nov. 28 letter , Proper states `` while we have no objection to your advertising the property as a location for a sports bar , using the Broncos ' name and colors gives the false impression that the bar is or can be affiliated with the Broncos . ''
S10	The land is valued at $ 650,000 and the bar could cost about $ 1 million to $ 1.2 million , Hanlon said .

S1 	WASHINGTON -LRB- AP -RRB- _ All else being equal , Duane Roelands would prefer to dash off short instant text messages to co-workers and friends with the service offered by Microsoft _ the one he finds easiest to use .
S2 	But for Roelands , all else is not equal : His office , clients and nearly everyone else he knows use America Online 's messaging system .
S3 	Now , he does too .
S4 	`` There are features that I want and I like , '' said Roelands , a Web developer , who likens it to the battle between VHS and Beta video recorders in the 1980s .
S5 	`` But the reality is if I use the better product , I get less functionality . ''
S6 	For this reason , instant messaging rivals like Microsoft , AT&T and ExciteAtHome maintain their users ought to be able to send messages to anyone else , regardless of what service they happen to have .
S7 	That 's not currently possible .
S8 	The companies are lobbying the Federal Communications Commission to require AOL to make its product compatible with those offered by competitors as a condition of its merger with Time Warner .
S9 	So far , the agency appears to favor a more tailored approach .
S10	The commission 's staff has recommended that AOL be required to make its system work with at least one other provider , but the requirement would apply only to advanced instant messaging services offered over Time Warner 's cable lines .
S11	How the agency defines advanced services is unclear .
S12	They could refer to features beyond text messaging , such as video teleconferencing , the sharing of files or messaging over interactive television .
S13	Today , consumers more commonly take advantage of the garden variety functions .
S14	They type short real-time phrases to others , allowing them to `` chat '' back-and-forth using text .
S15	Unlike e-mail , it 's instantaneous and gets the recipient 's attention right away .
S16	People can communicate with international friends without the hefty phone bills .
S17	And the service has taken hold with those who have hearing or speech disabilities .
S18	Unlike the telephone , people can discreetly interact with others _ or decide not to .
S19	`` It 's communications that can be ignored , '' said Jonathan Sacks , a vice president at AOL , which runs the two leading messaging services _ ICQ and AIM _ with 140 million users .
S20	`` On the telephone , you ca n't see when somebody is near the phone .
S21	You ca n't see when it 's convenient for them to communicate with you . ''
S22	AOL rivals say that if instant messaging is to be as ubiquitous as the phone network , it has to work the same way : People who use different providers must still be able to contact one another .
S23	They continue to lobby the FCC , hoping to see the conditions broadened before the agency issues its final decision .
S24	`` It 's really important to get this right before innovation is squashed because one company has a monopoly , '' said Jon Englund , vice president of government affairs for ExciteAtHome .
S25	`` It 's absolutely critical that Internet uses have real choice among competing platforms . ''
S26	AOL has said it wants to work toward interoperability , but first needs to protect consumer privacy and security to prevent the kinds of problems that have emerged in the e-mail world , like spamming _ unwanted junk messages .
S27	Company officials disagreed that AOL 's market share was keeping out competitors .
S28	AOL executives cited a recent study by Media Metrix indicating that the messaging services offered by Yahoo ! and Microsoft are the fastest growing in the United States .
S29	Why all the fuss over a free product that anyone , even those who do n't subscribe to AOL , can use ?
S30	Some pointed to the recent demise of two instant messaging competitors _ iCAST and Tribal Voice _ as evidence that AOL 's dominance could prevent choices in the market .
S31	Another concern is that AOL could use its substantial customer base to tack on new advanced services and then charge for them .
S32	Rivals said the ability of various services to work together will become increasingly important in the future .
S33	For example , as instant messaging migrates to cell phones or hand-held computer organizers , consumers wo n't want to have to install multiple services on these devices , said Brian Park , senior product for Yahoo !
S34	Communications Services .
S35	`` You can have the best service and the coolest features , but nobody is going to use it if it does n't communicate with other services , '' Park said .

S1 	Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , September 1st , by reporter Jingcai Wu The Weir Group of the US recently signed an implementation agreement in Beijing with Jiangsu Province 's Electric Power Department to build China 's first large-capacity power plant with liquefied natural gas as fuel .
S2 	Aixing Dan , director of the International Co-operation Department of the Electric Power Industry Ministry , on this matter , expressed to Xinhua News Agency reporters today that if this power plant is successful , it will be a model for similar plants to be built along coastal regions .
S3 	Coal , water , oil , etc. , are normally used for traditional electricity generation .
S4 	However , using liquefied natural gas as fuel for joint circulatory electricity generation has advantages of higher power generation efficiency and lower total cost , is beneficial to the environment , etc. . According to presentations , with this type of electricity generation method , a single engine with liquefied natural gas as fuel can produce waste gas with temperatures being as high as 500 to 600 degrees centigrade .

produce waste gas with temperatures being as high as 500 to 600
degrees centigrade. 
tokens: However , using liquefied natural gas as fuel for joint circulatory electricity generation has advantages of higher power generation efficiency and lower total cost , is beneficial to the environment , etc. . According to presentations , with this type of electricity generation method , a single engine with liquefied natural gas as fuel can produce waste gas with temperatures being as high as 500 to 600 degrees centigrade .
S5 	This gas in turn can heat a boiler for the production of steam to turn a steam turbine which generates electricity .
S6 	Because of the efficiency of this construction method , the electricity generated is relatively competitive in price .
S7 	At the same time , using natural gas as fuel will also reduce environmental pollution along coastal regions .
S8 	The Weir Group , whose headquarters is in the US , is a large , specialized corporation investing in the area of electricity generation .
S9 	The installed capacity of electricity it has invested in and developed globally has reached 15 million kilowatts .
S10	Through the contact of the Yizhong Company of the US , the Weir Group and the Jiangsu Electric Power Department reached an initial agreement on a plan to build a joint circulatory electricity generation plant .
S11	This power plant , which will be situated in Rudong , Jiangsu , has an annual generation capacity of 2.4 million kilowatts .
S12	The investment amount is 2.4 billion US dollars .
S13	The Chinese side holds 30 % of the shares while the Weir Group holds 70 % .
S14	According to the agreement , the Weir Group will be responsible for the supply of natural gas from the international market for use by the power plant .
S15	Renzu Luo , managing director of the Weir Group , is optimistic over the prospect of using liquefied natural gas as fuel for electricity generation along China 's coastal regions .
S16	He holds that according to the experience of Asian energy market development , liquefied natural gas has become the main material of clean fuel used for electricity generation .
S17	When the gross national product per capita reached 3000 US dollars in Japan , South Korea and Taiwan , etc. , environmental protection awareness generally rose , and all began to obviously increase usage of electricity generated by liquefied natural gas .
S18	As the gross national product in China 's coastal regions begins to approach this benchmark , it can be said to have had the conditions for electricity generation using natural gas in terms of financial resources .
S19	John Weir , president of the Weir Group who visited China with US Minister Brown and signed this agreement for electricity generation plant construction in Jiangsu , held that now is the best time to develop a project of joint circulatory electricity generation plant with natural gas as fuel in China .
S20	Both parties , the US and China , will invest more time , money and resources to make this power plant project a successful model .

S1 	in washington , u.s. officials are working overtime to find some way to defuse the volatile situation in the middle east as the two sides attack each other .
S2 	nbc 's joe johns reports .
S3 	secretary of state albright today turned up the pressure on palestinian leader yasser arafat to stop the violence .
S4 	he has been able in the past to control large portions of this .
S5 	we expect him to be able to control this .
S6 	israelis have long argued that arat can and should do just that .
S7 	so if mr. arafat can in one single word stop the violence and get back to the negotiations table , i think he will find readiness and willingness on the israeli side to reach a reasonable agreement .
S8 	but as protests in support of the palestinians sprang up from egypt to morocco to iraq , arafat 's advisers suggested that his power to stop the violence may be limited .
S9 	president arafat can not give orders to a people , to a whole nation , that is being killed every day and being asked to lie back and to die quietly , not to defend themselves .
S10	the disagreement over which side should bear the greatest blame spilled over to the united nations .
S11	a security council resolution criticized israel .
S12	the u.s. tried to water down the measure , then abstained from voting .
S13	the administration , hoping to de-escalate the violence , is appealing to both sides .
S14	that requires even greater efforts on the part of the palestinian authority to try to control the crowds , to keep them away from israeli fixed positions and on the israeli side that would enable them to restrain the use of live fire .
S15	aids to president clinton say he has proposed a middle east summit in egypt as early as this week .
S16	aids do not rule out the possibility of the president attending if israeli and palestinian leaders agree to the meeting .
S17	joe johns , nbc news , the white house .

S1 	good evening .
S2 	there is n't a national poll in the race between vice president al gore and governor george w. bush that shows a clear advantage for one or the other with two weekends to go .
S3 	according to today 's msnbc\/reuters tracking poll , gore is hanging onto a two-point lead over bush for the second day in a row .
S4 	but all these polls , it 's important to point out , are within a margin of error that could flip the results .
S5 	what they 're really telling us is that the race appears to be a dead heat .
S6 	and with time running short , the final strategies are taking a sharper form .
S7 	nbc 's david gregory is with the governor again tonight , claire shipman with the vice president .
S8 	claire , the gore campaign worried about ralph nader .
S9 	reporter : tom , the greening of al gore today -- his environmental message has n't always been a priority on the campaign trail , but now , with fears of ralph nader 's growing support , it could be critical .
S10	al gore , today hopscotching across the midwest , reminding voters of his environmentalist credentials .
S11	together , we can clean up the environment .
S12	reporter : seizing on a new u.n. report about global warming , he pitches his message in diners .
S13	one that i 've worked on a lot , one people do n't talk about , is global warming .
S14	reporter : and even to tv personality queen latifah .
S15	the environment is at stake in this election .
S16	reporter : why ?
S17	it 's a message that appeals to those critical undecided voters and especially the supporters of this man , ralph nader .
S18	once a minor distraction , gore aides now fear nader could cost them the election .
S19	how much can nader hurt ?
S20	take oregon , a state gore was counting on .
S21	a recent poll has bush at 45 % , gore at 41 % and nader at 10 % .
S22	in traditionally democratic minnesota , bush has 44 % , gore 41 % , nader 8 % .
S23	here in wisconsin , gore has an edge in one poll , bush in another .
S24	nader remains steady at 5 % .
S25	those statistics have democrats cranking up the head on nader supporters .
S26	former gore rival bill bradley , on the stump today in washington state .
S27	pro-choice organizations are spending big money for ads like this one to make the case that a vote for nader could mean the end of a woman 's right to choose .
S28	before voting nader , consider the risk .
S29	it 's your choice .
S30	environmental groups are also getting involved .
S31	some prominent democrats are thinking about a full-page ad in `` the new york times . ''
S32	and look for states like oregon and minnesota to figure prominently on gore 's travel schedule in the final week .
S33	tom ?
S34	thanks very much , nbc 's claire shipman tonight .
S35	as for governor bush , he had some high-powered help today on the campaign trail and a more pointed commentary on the vice president .
S36	nbc 's david gregory with the vice president in pittsburgh tonight .
S37	reporter : tom , making it abundantly clear that the clinton\/gore scandals of the past eight years will be a major theme in the closing days of this campaign , bush attacks the vice president for being a failed leader and promises if he 's elected americans will once again be able to respect their government .
S38	bush campaigns today in this tough battleground state alongside the popular retired general colin powell and again hints strongly powell will be a member of his cabinet if elected .
S39	today 's address focuses on `` responsible leadership '' and how on issues like social security and medicare , the clinton\/gore administration has failed to pr they are going out as they came in -- their guide , the nightly polls .
S40	their goal , the morning headlines .
S41	their legacy , the fruitless search for a legacy .
S42	reporter : with the race so tight , advisers are hunkered down trying to for the final push .
S43	plotting out the final push that , aides say , is likely to include visits to eight different states bill clinton carried the last two elections .
S44	tom ?
S45	david gregory tonight with governor bush , not with vice president gore , obviously .

S1 	Swarms of jellyfish consumed so many fish eggs and larvae in the Gulf of Mexico this summer that some scientists are talking about the potential for serious future threats to commercial and recreational fisheries in the northern Gulf .
S2 	The jellyfish , a native species and an invading one , appeared in prime spawning areas just as breeding season for many of the Gulf 's most important species kicked into high gear .
S3 	According to the National Marine Fisheries Service , the number of jellyfish in the Gulf has been rising for at least 13 years .
S4 	Scientists say the jellyfish are exploiting three major human-induced changes in the environment : thousands of oil rigs and artificial reefs established to attract game fish have greatly increased the breeding habitat for jellyfish , which need a hard surface for spawning ; nitrogen pollution from farm runoff and industrial sources feeds plankton blooms , providing extra food for jellyfish ; and commercial fishermen take great numbers of menhaden , a soft-finned , bony fish that competes with jellyfish for the plankton .
S5 	Dr. Monty Graham , a researcher at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama , worries that with all these advantages jellyfish can not help but multiply at an astonishing rate .
S6 	Making matters much worse , he said , is the advent of Phyllorhiza punctata , or Australian spotted jellyfish .
S7 	The giant species , previously unreported in the Gulf , is a 25-pound bruiser of a jellyfish native to the Pacific .
S8 	Some time ago the basketball-size jellyfish established themselves in the Caribbean .
S9 	This summer , after apparently riding ocean currents north , they concentrated themselves in the passes between the barrier islands that separate the Mississippi Sound from the Gulf of Mexico .
S10	The Australian jellyfish have now mostly died off in the Gulf .
S11	But fishery scientists worry that they may already have affected next year 's fish populations .
S12	And scientists say the animals were spawning prodigiously , broadcasting millions of their own eggs as they ate the eggs and larvae of native species .
S13	Popular sport fish , including redfish , speckled trout , white trout and Spanish mackerel , as well as commercially important species like crabs and menhaden , spawn just outside the barrier islands .
S14	This year , their eggs and larvae had to drift with tidal currents through the jellyfish-choked passes to reach the estuaries that serve as nurseries for the baby fish .
S15	`` These things are incredibly efficient at turning the water over , cleaning it of everything in it , '' Graham said .
S16	`` We 're finding them with 200 fish eggs in their guts . ''
S17	The newcomers had a frighteningly effective feeding pattern that involved swimming to the surface , then diving down to the bottom , scouring the water of virtually every living thing smaller than a BB pellet .
S18	After flowing through the jellyfish gantlet , scientists said , the water was almost devoid of living things .
S19	`` You really have two problems in terms of commercially important fish , '' said Harriet M. Perry , director of the fisheries section of the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory in Mississippi .
S20	`` First the jellies are ingesting the larvae and eggs of these commercially important species , and then the fish larvae must compete with these incredibly efficient jellies for the same food source . ''
S21	Perry said she worried that the Phyllorhiza might become permanent residents .
S22	Graham said he feared that their offspring might appear in larger numbers next spring .
S23	He noted , though , that the newcomers represented a small threat compared with the monstrous herds of native moon jellyfish still swarming offshore below Alabama , Mississippi and Louisiana in a huge swath roughly 100 miles long and 30 miles wide .
S24	It is these jellyfish that worry Dr. Joanne Lyczkowski-Shultz , a larval specialist with the National Marine Fisheries Service .
S25	Lyczkowski-Shultz said the long-term picture might be bleak if the jellyfish populations continued to grow at their current pace .
S26	`` It could be totally devastating , '' she said .

S4   Scientists say the jellyfish are exploiting three major human-induced changes in the environment : thousands of oil rigs and artificial reefs established to attract game fish have greatly increased the breeding habitat for jellyfish , which need a hard surface for spawning ; nitrogen pollution from farm runoff and industrial sources feeds plankton blooms , providing extra food for jellyfish ; and commercial fishermen take great numbers of menhaden , a soft-finned , bony fish that competes with jellyfish for the plankton .

S1 	Since then , AOL 's stock has fallen by almost a third , destroying most of the premium the company had offered for control of Time Warner .
S2 	So a Time Warner shareholder might conclude that America Online 's chairman , Stephen Case , had bamboozled his Time Warner counterpart , Gerald Levin , into taking AOL 's shares at the worst possible time .
S3 	`` Short term , anyone objective would say probably Steve got the better part of the deal , '' said Larry Haverty , a senior vice president at State Street Research in Boston and a longtime media investor .
S4 	But Haverty , like many other Time Warner shareholders and industry analysts , hardly cares .
S5 	With the merger likely to be completed later this month , he predicts that the merged company will grow quickly by combining AOL 's marketing skills and captive base of online users with Time Warner 's huge library of films , magazines and the like and its relationships with major advertisers .
S6 	`` The deal strategically and financially makes all the sense in the world , '' Haverty said .
S7 	`` Five years out , if you 're a shareholder in this company , you 're going to be a happy camper . ''
S8 	That view is widely shared .
S9 	`` Strategically , it makes a lot of sense , '' said Tom Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein .
S10	`` These companies fill the holes of the other one .
S11	They 're subscription-advertising combo models .
S12	The reality is the pieces are very compatible . ''
S13	To be sure , the recent history of big media mergers is hardly comforting for shareholders in either AOL or Time Warner .
S14	Disney stumbled badly after it bought Capital Cities\/ABC in 1996 , and Time Warner stagnated for five years after it was created in 1990 by the merger of Time and Warner .
S15	`` Huge deals are really hard to do and create a lot of uncertainty , '' said Roger McNamee of Integral Capital , which sold its 404,000 AOL shares the day the merger was announced .
S16	But if the merged company can overcome that hurdle , it will have big advantages over Disney and other traditional media companies , which are still struggling to figure out how they can profit from the Internet , said Jessica Reif of Merrill Lynch .
S17	`` Given the multiple distribution platforms that they have , it 's obviously a very powerful consumer engine , '' Reif said .
S18	`` There 's a reason that you see Disney and to a lesser extent NBC screaming in Washington . ''
S19	John Schreiber , an assistant portfolio manager at Janus Capital , the mutual fund company that is Time Warner 's largest shareholder , with more than 120 million shares , said the companies had already begun to demonstrate how they would work together .
S20	For example , AOL has pitched Time Warner 's magazines to its users , resulting in hundreds of thousands of new subscriptions .
S21	And the companies are trying to sell big advertisers on deals that will reach both America Online users and the people who watch Time Warner cable channels and read its magazines , Schreiber said .
S22	`` Once the merger closes , I think you 'll see some very powerful cross-promotional deals across all of Time Warner 's advertisers , '' he said .
S23	Schreiber also says the risk of cultural clashes between the companies is limited , because the companies disclosed publicly where top executives would stand in the combined company only a few weeks after the merger was announced .
S24	So people who feel their responsibilities have been diminished have had months to look for new jobs , and some have already left , he said .
S25	Given the strength he sees in the combined company , Schreiber said the question of whether Levin could have negotiated a better deal with America Online is moot .
S26	Shares in cable companies like Comcast have fallen 15 percent or more this year , while big media companies have been flat or up slightly .
S27	So `` it 's not as if Time Warner shareholders have lost out on a great deal of upside , '' Schreiber said .

S1 	CHATTANOOGA , Tenn. _ Nearly 17 months after he first issued his call for a `` fresh start after a season of cynicism , '' Gov. George W. Bush ended his quest for the presidency Monday on a nearly identical note , pledging to purge Washington of what he cast as a crippling discord .
S2 	The course that Bush charted over his final hours on the campaign trail , plotted with as much concern for symbolism as for raw electoral arithmetic , left no doubt about where he placed the blame for that atmosphere .
S3 	His first major rally was in Tennessee and his last was planned for Arkansas , the home states , respectively , of Vice President Al Gore and President Clinton .
S4 	The Texas governor 's words made equally clear that he saw himself as the country 's best hope for bridging ideological divides , healing partisan wounds and making sure that Americans could gaze upon the White House with unfettered respect .
S5 	`` There 's a better day ahead if we have a leader who 's willing to unite the country , to bring people together , to elevate the people 's business above everyday politics , '' Bush said at a rally inside a hangar at the airport here , where supporters ' chants evoked the nearness of the moment of decision .
S6 	`` One more day ! '' they roared .
S7 	`` One more day ! ''
S8 	What the nation needed , Bush told them , was `` a president who can unite this nation , a president who puts aside the endless partisan bickering that seems to gridlock our nation 's capitol , a president who puts the people first , a president who lifts this nation 's spirits .
S9 	`` I 'll be that president , '' he added , a sentence that was equal parts promise and prediction .
S10	It underscored the optimism that Bush has , from the very beginning , sought to project to voters .
S11	His schedule over the course of a 16-hour day was also an expression of that confidence .
S12	In between Tennessee and Arkansas , his campaign plane touched down in Wisconsin and Iowa , and while any one of those four states could wind up providing the key to a Bush victory , none have as many electoral votes as such battlegrounds as Michigan and Pennsylvania .
S13	But they are genuine tossups that were initially predicted to be much more hospitable to Gore .
S14	By visiting them Monday , Bush emphasized the breadth of his appeal and the sometimes surprising vulnerability of the vice president .
S15	He did not let his assertion of strength and confidence distract him from the important business of beseeching supporters to grant him victory .
S16	With just 24 hours before Election Day , Bush in many ways stripped campaigning to its essence : coaxing and cajoling , pleading and persuading .
S17	`` I want you to understand that I ca n't win without you , '' Bush told a crowd of more than 1,000 people at a convention center in Green Bay , Wis. `` I hope you redouble your efforts to make sure people get out to the polls . ''
S18	Minutes later , he added : `` When you go out there and tell the folks where we stand on the issues and where we stand when it comes to bringing people together to get things done , and you tell them that the core of this campaign is the inherent trust in the American people , I believe it does n't matter what political party they 're in .
S19	They 're going to come our way . ''
S20	In Chattanooga , Bush repeatedly needled Gore , which was much of the point of going to Tennessee , where Gore is not at all certain to prevail on Tuesday .
S21	The Texas governor claimed that Gore 's decades of experience in Washington had estranged him from the rest of the country by making him too trusting of federal government and too fond of federal spending .
S22	`` My opponent vows to carry his home state , '' Bush said .
S23	`` He may win Washington , D.C. , but he 's not going to win Tennessee .
S24	`` He forgot his roots , '' Bush added .
S25	`` He forgot where he 's from .
S26	He trusts Washington .
S27	We trust the people . ''

S1 	WASHINGTON _ Ralph Nader may not be feeling any regrets about his Green Party presidential campaign , but some visitors to the chat room on Nader2000 . org , Nader 's official campaign website , sounded as if a bad hangover had come crashing down on them .
S2 	There was this entry , for instance , posted Thursday morning by a writer named `` wreckz '' : `` I , too , feel I should apologize to America .
S3 	I was duped .
S4 	Ralph Nader 's enjoyment of all of this is an indication of a man more concerned with vindictive politics than the future of our country and planet .
S5 	I am no longer a member of the Green Party .
S6 	Instead , I 'm a member of the green movement _ a movement without Ralph Nader . ''
S7 	Or this one , also posted Thursday morning , from `` Noni '' : `` I saw an interview with Ralph Nader today and he seemed to be enjoying what has happened !
S8 	I 've never seen him smile so broadly .
S9 	I regret my support .
S10	Nader , you 're a well-intending man and I agree with most of your positions .
S11	But the symbolic run for the White House has destroyed our Party and our cause .
S12	Very bad things are in our future .
S13	You should not be smiling .
S14	And we , the misled , should feel shame for what we 've done . ''
S15	The remarks expressed fears that votes for Nader may have put Gov. George W. Bush in a position to defeat Vice President Al Gore .
S16	In Florida , where Gore trailed Bush by only a few hundred votes Thursday , a shift of just a fraction of Nader 's 95,000 votes could have given the state , and the White House , to Gore , the most likely major-party alternative for Nader 's supporters .
S17	John Ruth , for example , wrote on the Nader2000 site Thursday morning that he voted for Nader because he thought they `` shared a common goal '' but that he was now regretting it .
S18	`` Gore -LRB- despite what you have said -RRB- is NOT an environmental clone of G.W. Bush .
S19	Because of your actions and statements prior to Nov. 7th , we are on the brink of a Bush presidency .
S20	No money , no support , no respect for you , Ralph , ever again ! ''
S21	And in Oregon , a state that was still too close to call Thursday afternoon , Nader won about 5 percent of the vote _ enough to cause some Nader voters to feel morning-after qualms .
S22	Julie Quastler , 28 , who voted for Nader in Portland , said on Wednesday that she was feeling `` a little alarmed and disappointed '' that Bush seemed on the brink of winning the presidency _ suggesting that she did not accept Nader 's assertion that the two parties were equally bad .
S23	`` I 'm just so sad , '' she said .
S24	`` Bush is probably going to be our president and Nader did n't get his 5 percent .
S25	It seems like a lose-lose end result in some ways . ''
S26	Winning 5 percent of the vote nationwide would have qualified the Green Party for millions of dollars in federal campaign funds in 2004 .
S27	But Quastler , the development director for a nonprofit cafe , said she did not feel guilty about her vote .
S28	`` I voted for Nader because he was most aligned with my values , '' she said .
S29	Of course , there were also countless verbal high-fives among Nader supporters Thursday who felt the Green Party had sent a bracing wake-up call to the two major parties .
S30	`` Stand tall and proud , fellow Nader supporters , '' said one message on the Nader2000 site signed GO LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR SCAPEGOATS .
S31	`` We fought the good fight for what we believed in .
S32	This does not make us villains . ''
S33	Such sentiments seemed particularly strong in Florida .
S34	Dorothy Byrne , a state coordinator for the Florida Green Party , said she had been inundated with angry phone calls and e-mails from Democrats , but has yet to receive one regretful note from a Nader voter .
S35	`` I can see positives for the Greens with either Bush or Gore being president , '' she said .
S36	`` If Gore was in , we would n't have to worry about women 's reproductive rights .
S37	But his record on the environment is so abysmal I do n't see how Bush can be any worse . ''
S38	Barbara Lange , the Everglades chairwoman for the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club , said she and other environmentalists voted for Nader because Gore had not taken a stand against the development of a commercial airport near the Everglades .

S1 	It 's time again to ask 20 questions about advertising , marketing and the media .
S2 	_ Will Americans ever refer to the day before Thanksgiving as `` Thanksgiving Wednesday , '' as ABC did repeatedly this week in commercials promoting its Wednesday sitcoms `` The Drew Carey Show '' and `` Spin City '' ? _ If a Hollywood studio makes a movie about the Florida election standoff , would the title be `` It 's a Chad , Chad , Chad , Chad World '' ? _ How many readers of The Wall Street Journal noticed that an article on Wednesday carrying the headline `` Genetically Altered Protein Is Found in Still More Corn '' ran adjacent to an advertisement for a golf tournament on Fox Sports sponsored by Sun Microsystems that featured a fanciful photograph of a gigantic ear of corn as big as a Buick ?
S3 	_ Does n't a new television commercial for Fidelity Investments , centered on a telephone conversation between a female employee and a male customer , resemble a Citibank campaign from the late 1980s that was so brilliantly parodied as the `` First Citiwide Change Bank '' commercials on `` Saturday Night Live '' ? _ Did shoppers at the New York supermarket chain Gristede 's rush to take advantage of a recent sale on the `` BIG 150-count box '' of Scotties facial tissues , or did they recall that Scotties has usually come in a 175-count box ?
S4 	.
S5 	_ Why did the Reader 's Digest Association go to the trouble of airbrushing the identifying information from a label on a pair of jeans worn by a man in a photograph featured in an ad for Reader 's Digest magazine , but leave the red tab on the back pocket that tells everyone the pants are Levi 's ? _ Do television commercials for prescription drugs disclose that side effects in tests were no worse `` than a sugar pill '' because research found that consumers were n't familiar with the word `` placebo '' ? _ What was in the zeitgeist that led two disparate advertisers _ Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield and the MSN network of Microsoft _ to introduce about the same time campaigns centered on butterflies ?
S6 	_ And what was in the zeitgeist that led two automotive marketers _ Land Rover and Volvo _ to introduce about the same time commercials centered on drivers rescuing animals on rainy roads ?
S7 	_ Are folks old enough to remember the heyday of the radio and television personality Arthur Godfrey reminded of his longtime greeting , `` How are ya ? , '' every time they hear the name of the new Lucent Technologies spinoff company , Avaya Communication ?
S8 	_ How appealing was a recent offer made by Sprint Communications Co. to give buyers of a Sprint PCS telephone and a calling plan a free `` pre-owned phone '' ? _ Was it an inside joke that the name of the character played by John Corbett on `` Sex and the City , '' Aidan Shaw , was almost identical to the name of a longtime star of gay sex films , Aiden Shaw ?
S9 	_ How many tickets did the Houston Grand Opera sell after mailing out a promotional brochure featuring photographs of cattle with headlines like `` It 's udderly fantastic entertainment ! '' and `` Great opera .
S10	No bull . '' ? _ If CBS shows the first episode of `` Survivor II '' after its broadcast of Super Bowl XXXV , will the network someday show the first episode of `` Survivor XXXV '' after its broadcast of Super Bowl LXVIII ?
S11	_ Will cheerful chorus members dressed in V-neck sweaters interrupt their serenades to online shopping long enough to tell an advertising columnist , `` You ask a lot of questions for someone from Brooklyn '' ?

S1 	HONG KONG _ For most of this year , Asia 's economies have performed a sort of levitating act _ growing by double-digit rates month after month even as economists predicted they would fall to earth .
S2 	That dichotomy was on vivid display here Friday : Hong Kong reported that its economic output surged 10.4 percent in the third quarter , and it raised its projection for full-year growth to 10 percent from 8.5 percent .
S3 	Yet a block away , the International Monetary Fund warned in a news conference that Asian economies could be hit hard by soaring oil prices and turmoil in the financial markets .
S4 	The IMF said a $ 5 increase in the price of a barrel of oil could slow the growth rates of Asian countries next year .
S5 	`` The prospects for growth in 2001 have weakened , '' said David Robinson , assistant director of research at the fund .
S6 	`` There has also been increased political instability across the world , not least in Asia . ''
S7 	Several Asian countries _ notably the Philippines , Taiwan , and Indonesia _ have been gripped by political tumult in recent weeks .
S8 	The Philippines president , Joseph Estrada , was impeached last week , while Chen Shui-bian , the president of Taiwan , is trying to fend off a recall vote .
S9 	Even in more stable countries , like Malaysia and South Korea , Robinson said the Fund was concerned by the haphazard pace of economic reforms .
S10	In many countries , the banks and corporations remain financially shaky .
S11	`` We 're still seeing chaebols in deep trouble , '' he said , referring to Korea 's heavily indebted conglomerates .
S12	But Robinson acknowledged that these weaknesses had not yet been reflected in the economic performance of the countries .
S13	On Tuesday , South Korea reported a 9.2 percent increase in its third-quarter output _ beating the estimates of most analysts and extending a string of powerful quarters .
S14	Indonesia , Malaysia , and Singapore have also beaten expectations , while Hong Kong 's growth rate was nearly three percentage points above a median forecast of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News .
S15	Like other Asian economies , Hong Kong has been buoyed by an unquenchable appetite for its exports , principally in the United States .
S16	Exports surged 17.7 percent in the third quarter .
S17	Hong Kong has done a particularly booming business in repackaging and shipping goods from mainland China .
S18	Consumer spending rose by a much less impressive 5.6 percent , as retail sales slackened from the second quarter .
S19	And consumer prices fell 2 percent , extending a decline that began during the crisis .
S20	Ian Perkin , chief economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce said the double-digit growth in Hong Kong and other Asian countries masked their underlying condition .
S21	While the region 's growth in exports has been torrid , domestic demand has remained tenuous .
S22	`` We have n't built up our domestic economies yet , '' he said .
S23	`` The recovery has relied almost completely on export growth .
S24	`` If consumer spending slows down in the States , it will have a devastating effect on Asia , '' said Perkin .
S25	`` 2001 could be a crunch year . ''
S26	Robinson of the IMF was similarly wary about next year .
S27	In October , the IMF projected that the world economy would grow 4.2 percent in 2001 , while Asia as a region would grow 6.6 percent .
S28	On Friday , Robinson said the growth rate could be lower , though he would not say by how much .
S29	A principal culprit of possibly slower growth is the dependence of many Asian countries on imported oil .
S30	Oil prices have risen $ 5 per barrel since the IMF issued its semi-annual economic outlook in October .
S31	Asia has little control over oil , but Robinson said the region could improve its economic prospects by calming its political waters .
S32	One bright spot in the Asian landscape is China , which is on track to record 8 percent growth in 2000 .
S33	Robinson said the main question facing Chinese leaders was whether they need to spend billions of dollars in public funds to further stimulate an economy that was already expanding .
S34	Like Perkin , Robinson said Asia 's future depended in large part on the health of the United States .
S35	But he disputed those who predict dramatically slowing growth _ the so-called hard landing _ for the American economy .
S36	`` The chances of that happening are less than 40 percent , '' he said , `` substantially less . ''

S1 	GROSSE POINTE PARK , Mich. _ It is deer hunting season in Michigan , and hunters who climb trees with loaded shotguns have state officials redoubling safety education efforts .
S2 	Two men have been killed , and a third has been injured since the hunting season opened on Nov. 15 .
S3 	All three accidents involved shotguns , elevated platforms and a practice relatively new to Michigan hunters _ shooting at deer from trees .
S4 	The Michigan season , one of the busiest , continues through Nov. 30 .
S5 	Firearm hunting from elevated platforms has long been legal in other states with heavy hunting , like New York and Pennsylvania .
S6 	But the practice is only in its third season in Michigan , and officials say it appears that hunters still have a lot to learn about safety .
S7 	Lt. Suzanne Koppelo , hunter safety administrator of the law enforcement division of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources &UR; , &LR; said that since firearm platform hunting began in Michigan there had been seven shooting accidents linked to the practice .
S8 	Three were fatal .
S9 	Two hunters shot themselves on platforms and another was killed on the ground by a hunter shooting from a platform .
S10	`` If hunters exercised the kind of caution one would expect at heights of 20-some feet , it would be almost a nonissue , '' said Koppelo .
S11	`` But given human nature , that 's not the case . ''
S12	More than 750,000 licensed hunters are taking to the Michigan woods this year , where they are expected to kill about 500,000 of the state 's 1.9 million deer .
S13	The numbers reinforce the need to improve education about platform hunting with firearms , Koppelo said .
S14	The practice is more commonly associated with hunters using bows and arrows .
S15	Instead of hiding on the ground or walking through the woods , they wait quietly , typically at a height of 15 to 20 feet , and fire down at deer that wander below .
S16	Despite the hunter killed from the platform , Sgt. Larry D. Sargent , hunter education field coordinator for the law enforcement division , says the practice does offer one safety advantage : errant shots typically thump harmlessly to the ground , rather than whistling through the woods and striking other people .
S17	The problems primarily arise when hunters get in and out of position .
S18	`` It 's kind of hard climbing a tree with a gun , '' Rob Williams said , as he and a hunting partner , Art Bush , waited on a recent morning in a conventional earthbound hunting blind about 20 miles west of Detroit .
S19	For Williams , Rule No. 1 is not to climb a tree with a loaded gun .
S20	He says that when he hunts from a platform he climbs up with a rope dangling from his belt to his gun , which he leaves unloaded on the ground .
S21	When he is secure in his stand , he pulls his gun up after him and loads it .
S22	Sargent says this is proper procedure .
S23	One accident this year , however , illustrates the importance of following each step of the safety procedures .
S24	A 16-year-old hunter used a haul line , but it was tied to the trigger guard and he left the gun loaded , Koppelo said .
S25	The teen-ager 's gun went off and he was shot in the foot .
S26	Others are hurt falling out of trees .
S27	Koppelo said that state officials were trying to keep count of these injuries but that it was difficult , since they relied on hunters reporting minor accidents .
S28	`` A lot of guys are embarrassed , '' Sargent said .
S29	`` They 'll say they fell working in the yard or something . ''
S30	Others , Koppelo says , do not want to report accidents for fear the law will be changed .
S31	And she adds that though anecdotal reports show Michigan 's large hunting population to be taking slowly to firearm deer hunting from platforms , most expect the practice to catch on as it has in other states .
S32	As Peter Thompson , a 16-year-old hunter , said , `` Usually the deer do n't look up . ''

S1 	TALLAHASSEE , Fla. _ Lawyers for Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday their only chance for victory in his contest of the Florida election would be shattered if they have to wait until Saturday to begin counting disputed ballots , and they began an appeal to the Florida Supreme Court to do the counting itself , immediately .
S2 	The appeal was filed with the District Court of Appeal late Wednesday afternoon , and will be submitted to the state 's highest court early Thursday , Gore 's lawyers said .
S3 	It essentially asks the Supreme Court to take over Gore 's contest lawsuit from the slow-moving trial court , to count the ballots itself , and eventually to declare Gore the winner if he wins the recount .
S4 	But lawyers for Gov. George W. Bush said they had no intention of allowing any hand counting to begin without a vigorous legal fight .
S5 	To that end , they persuaded Circuit Judge N. Sanders Sauls to order 1.1 million ballots _ every vote cast in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties _ brought up from south Florida and placed in the court 's custody .
S6 	That represents 83 times the number of disputed ballots that the judge had agreed on Tuesday to transport to Tallahassee at the Gore team 's request .
S7 	And it could take weeks if not months to count them all , the point that Barry Richard , Bush 's chief trial lawyer here , said he was trying to make in requesting that the ballots be transported here .
S8 	`` We did it to make a point , '' Richard said in an interview .
S9 	`` If you recount any ballots , you have to recount all of them .
S10	Now , we do n't think any ballots should be counted , because the manual recount of ballots is finished .
S11	But in the event the court determines that some ballots should be counted , we wanted them here so they could all be counted . ''
S12	Aware that they could not stop the movement of all the ballots , Gore 's lawyers barely objected to the move , asking only that the disputed ballots that might contain hidden Gore votes be separated from the mass.
S13	`` I know when it 's futile , '' said David Boies , Gore 's chief trial lawyer , to Sauls .
S14	Nonetheless , Gore 's lawyers were furious at the move , aware that it represents yet another enormous barrier to their hopes for an immediate count of the 14,000 disputed ballots in the two counties and a quick decision from the judge that Gore really won the election .
S15	Even if the Florida Supreme Court should swiftly agree to their request and orders the counting to begin by Friday , that would still put them three days behind their original timetable .
S16	And facing a Dec. 12 deadline for the state to name electors for the Electoral College , Gore has absolutely no days to spare .
S17	`` It 's a stunt , '' said Kendall Coffey , one of Gore 's election lawyers , as he stormed out of Sauls ' courtroom Wednesday , referring to the request for all the ballots .
S18	`` They 're trying to bog down the case , the system , the clerk 's office and everywhere else they can . ''
S19	The decision by Gore 's lawyers to appeal the case shows how perilous their situation is .
S20	By appealing , the lawyers were forced to put on paper their fear that their case could be over if they can not begin counting ballots until Saturday .
S21	The decision to wait until a Saturday hearing `` is effectively a final order denying all relief sought by plaintiffs because the action now pending below must be completed before Dec. 12 , 2000 , in order to offer any relief , '' said the notice filed with the Court of Appeal .
S22	It adds , `` the court must allow sufficient time to complete an accurate and fair count of the contested ballots , which is essential for the proper resolution of the contest action . ''
S23	But the decision to bring up all the ballots means that they will not be assembled in Tallahassee until late Friday , a day later than planned .
S24	And even then , the hurdles are enormous .
S25	There will have to be another hearing before the Florida Supreme Court , and Gore 's lawyers will have to refute three arguments to be raised by the Bush team : There should be no more counting at all ; if there is any counting , it will have to include all 1.16 million ballots ; and if there is any counting of disputed ballots , dimples can not be counted as votes .
S26	If these issues are heard before Sanders , there will have to be briefs , witnesses , and evidence on each point , which could take days .
S27	If the Supreme Court agrees to short-circuit the process , there will still have to be lengthy briefs filed , and the court may need to wait several days before finding time for yet another momentous hearing in its schedule .

S1 	Booking Your Ticket : _ Fly nonstop .
S2 	The fewer connections you make , the lower the chance that you will suffer a delay .
S3 	_ Pick airports with care .
S4 	If you have to connect , choose the least-congested airport possible ; some airports , like Chicago O'Hare and La Guardia in New York , experience chronic delays .
S5 	Take into consideration the weather and the season ; an airport in the South might have fewer winter snowstorms but more spring and summer thunderstorms .
S6 	_ Check times between connecting flights .
S7 	Airlines often book tight connections and do not take responsibility if you miss yours .
S8 	Assume each leg of your flight will arrive late , and book connections that allow ample time .
S9 	_ Check on-time records .
S10	The Transportation Department requires major domestic airlines to make the on-time record for every flight available to consumers .
S11	You can check online at www.dot.gov/airconsumer .
S12	That site also reports each airline 's on-time record for the previous month .
S13	_ Travel on off-peak days and at off-peak times .
S14	Saturday is usually the least-traveled day of the week ; so are major holidays .
S15	Monday mornings and Friday afternoons are peak travel times for business travelers .
S16	Flights leaving earlier in the day are less likely to be delayed , because of the cascading effect that disruptions have on airline schedules .
S17	_ Use smaller airports .
S18	Instead of Los Angeles International , for example , consider flying into Burbank or John Wayne Airport in Orange County , Calif. , or use Westchester County Airport instead of JFK in New York .
S19	_ Avoid electronic tickets .
S20	Though they are convenient and more secure than an easily lost paper ticket , they are not transferable between most airlines if you need to switch carriers because of delays .
S21	_ Watch for labor disruptions .
S22	Check newspapers and Web sites like www.thenewfoundlandgroup.com to identify airlines experiencing labor strife , which often increases cancellations and delays .
S23	_ Leave a number .
S24	Make sure the airline you book with has a phone number at which you can be notified of delays or cancellations .
S25	_ Use a travel agent .
S26	A good one can be a great ally in the event of a problem _ and may save you time and money .
S27	Day of Departure : _ Be informed .
S28	Check your flight 's status before heading to the airport .
S29	Automated telephone services or airline Web sites often provide more up-to-date information than do ticket agents .
S30	The Federal Aviation Administration 's Web site , www.fly.faa.gov , has real-time information on operations at the biggest airports .
S31	_ Pack defensively .
S32	Take along a change of clothes and a toothbrush in your carry-on bag .
S33	If traveling with an infant , take 24 hours ' worth of diapers and extra formula .
S34	When possible , avoid checking luggage , in case you need to switch flights or carriers .
S35	Ship your gifts ahead .
S36	_ Educate yourself .
S37	Find out what your airline promises to do for passengers in the event of a delay .
S38	Print out a copy of the policy from the airline 's Web site , and carry it with you _ in case the airline representatives need a reminder .
S39	If a Flight Is Delayed : _ Keep your cool .
S40	Becoming angry at airline personnel is counterproductive .
S41	Sympathy for their plight will sometimes produce results .
S42	_ Do n't stand in line .
S43	To get on another flight , it is often more effective to call the airline from the airport than to wait at the ticket counter .
S44	Carry a cell phone ; if delays are widespread , public telephones may be in demand .
S45	_ Check the competition .
S46	If another airline has seats to your destination , ask your airline to endorse your ticket to the other line .
S47	_ Get what you paid for .
S48	If you paid full fare or are a high-mileage frequent flier , let the airline know .
S49	Your odds of getting a seat on the next flight out will increase , or the airline might pay for your hotel , if you are delayed overnight .
S50	_ Consider driving .
S51	If the last leg of your flight is a 200-mile hop , renting a car might be a better choice than waiting out a delay .
S52	Getting Even : _ Write a letter .
S53	The airlines have pledged to respond to consumer complaints within 60 days .
S54	They almost always offer a refund , reimbursement of expenses , a discount on your next ticket _ or all three .
S55	Be sure to save the relevant paperwork .
S56	_ Make it a federal case .
S57	Send a copy of your letter to Washington .
S58	Complaints are charged against each airline in the Transportation Department 's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and serve as a basis for rule making and enforcement action .
S59	Write to : Aviation Consumer Protection Div . -LRB- C-75 -RRB- Department of Transportation 400 Seventh St. S.W. Washington , DC 20590

S1 	Documented .
S2 	From NPR news in Washington , I 'm Corey Flintoff .
S3 	A Florida State judge has ordered local election officials to ship thousands of ballots to the state capital .
S4 	The move comes as the judge decides whether to order a recount of those ballots in the presidential election .
S5 	NPR 's Steve Inski was in the courtroom .
S6 	Steve , what are the issues that came up in this hearing tonight ?
S7 	Corey judge N. Sander Sauls is deciding whether to order a recount as you said of those ballots , 9000 or more actually from Miami Dade County that apparently were never counted at all , at least according to the Democrats in the presidential election and about 3300 ballots from Palm Beach County that were considered by local officials but then thrown out , disallowed .
S8 	Judge Sauls is deciding whether to count those ballots and go through them and perhaps add some votes to Al Gore 's final total , which is exactly what the Democrats want .
S9 	He is not ready to do that yet .
S10	He did not agree to the Democratic proposal to begin counting tomorrow morning but he has ordered that the ballots be shipped up .
S11	Later this week , Miami Police apparently are going to escort them upto Tallahassee and they will be ready to be counted if the judge decides at a later time to do so .
S12	Now time is a big consideration from here .
S13	What 's the judge 's timetable ?
S14	Not as fast as the Democrats would like , not as slowly as Republicans would prefer .
S15	He is going to order a major hearing on Saturday to review all the legal and evidentiary issues , look at evidence , perhaps hear from witnesses and after that the judge will decide if there are any ballots to count .
S16	It might take another five days or so to do it .
S17	Neither side seemed particularly pleased by the timetable but the judge said , well , I am going to make everybody equally unhappy .
S18	Thank you .
S19	NPR 's Steven Inksi reporting from Tallahassee , Florida .
S20	As the battle over votes goes on in Florida , Washington State is in the middle of recounting the votes cast in its very tight US Senate race .
S21	Jennifer Nesan reports from member station KPLU in Seattle .
S22	The recount of the votes cast for Democrat Maria Catwell and Republican Senator Slate Gordon is calm and organized .
S23	The State 's Elections Director Garry Macintosh says the process is about as exciting as watching paint dry .
S24	There are a lot of things about the election 's process I think that are fairly complex .
S25	This is n't probably one of them .
S26	Catwell leads Republican incumbent Slate Gordon by fewer then 2000 votes .
S27	At this point neither of the candidates plan to contest any of the votes .
S28	State law requires a recount when the margin of victory is less than one half of 1 percent .
S29	The recount is expected to be completed by the end of the week .
S30	No statewide recount in Washington has ever changed the initial outcome .
S31	For NPR news , I 'm Jennifer Nesan in Seattle .

S1 	Welcome to this hour of VOA News Now .
S2 	I 'm Erin Brumett in Washington .
S3 	The incredibly close Florida vote count for President is in the state courts and heading for the US Supreme Court at the end of the week .
S4 	That 's virtually unprecedented , as the Federal Courts have tended to stay out of elections , which are the responsibility of the states .
S5 	Joe O'Grossman is a professor of constitutional law at Baltimore 's Johns Hopkins University .
S6 	He says that in this instance the Supreme Court probably felt the circumstances were such that they had no real alternative but to take the case .
S7 	Well , I think they took the case because it seemed like it was such a important issue that it would be kind of unseemly for them to try to reject it out of hand .
S8 	In fact , I think that Lawrence Tribe , the Harvard Law School Professor who is arguing for Gore tomorrow , is going to ask the court to hold the case , moot and dismiss it .
S9 	And the Bush campaign has brought the case , but recognizes that the particular issues that they brought to the court last week are really not very relevant anymore .
S10	They are going to probably , well , I know what they are going to do .
S11	They are going to try to broaden the case to make it a kind of a general referendum on election procedures .
S12	So , they are looking for a coronation .
S13	And the Gore people at this point just want to get rid of this case , because they think they have a better chance in the Florida courts .
S14	Republicans generally support states ' rights .
S15	So , does it appear somewhat ironic that they are going to the Supreme Court in this instance ?
S16	No , I think first of all the notion that Republicans favor states ' rights and Democrats oppose it , is much too simplistic .
S17	That 's generally true , but it 's only true on some issues .
S18	And in this case , you could argue that the Bush people are going to the Supreme Court to preserve the right of Florida , to determine its own electors .
S19	So , there is a kind of states ' rights issue there .
S20	But they need , or at least they once thought they needed the Supreme Court to endorse it .
S21	So it goes both ways .
S22	What are the justices likely looking for ?
S23	Well , I do n't know .
S24	But I think that - and I think they will be divided , I mean I do n't think they will be unanimous .
S25	Obviously , they would like to be able to achieve some kind of resolution of the case .
S26	American election laws are often challenged at the local level and sometimes in the Federal courts , but this is certainly the first time we have had a Supreme Court challenge over presidential election .
S27	So , there is a lot of new law here to be made or at least law that has n't been made yet .
S28	It 's possible that if the court accepts the invitation of the Bush campaign , at least as it is expressed in the briefs they submitted yesterday , that the court will in the sense , take the entire issue , even - not just the specific questions that it was asked last week and try to resolve the question .
S29	For example , if the court says it is clearly the fact that the legislature of the state of Florida can determine for itself who its electors will be , that will pretty much end the case , because that 's what the legislature already plans to do .
S30	And that does n't mean the Gore people wo n't keep trying , because ultimately Congress has to decide and only Congress can decide if there are competing slates of electors submitted , which slate to accept .
S31	The Johns Hopkins University constitutional law professor Joe O'Grossman says , it 's still not certain the Supreme Court will actually hear the Florida case .
S32	As their first order , business Friday , attorneys for Vice President Gore will move to have the court dismiss the case brought by Republican George W Bush .
