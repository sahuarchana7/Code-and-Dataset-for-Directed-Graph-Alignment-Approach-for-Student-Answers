== Pronoun resolution ==

= Syntactic Type opportunities:

We don't know "Putin" is a person.  This causes errors, because "he" that should resolve go to a different, wrong, entity.


= First and second person pronouns, complicated.
= Dialogue and quotations, complicated.

WRONG resolved pronoun        : M74 -> M72                  NP[he]    ->   NP[defenseman Ray Bourque]
  == S15  `` We 've always stuck together and we 'll stick by Patrick , '' defenseman Ray Bourque said .
  == S16  `` We know he is a quality person and a great family man . ''

(Counting the second as an error is slightly dubious, though the best reading is perhaps as one entity, not two.  It is a complicated case.)


Pred-nom: genuine semantic errors from this rule.

The Taliban are predominantly Sunni Muslim , which is the majority Islamic sect in the country .

ace_rothdev/APW20001202_0257_0120 S13  Koetter may not have been Arizona State 's top choice .

NP[that president]    ->   NP[I]
`` I 'll be that president , '' he added , a sentence that was equal parts promise and prediction .

I think I'm right!!!
NP[president]    ->   NP[either Bush or Gore]
S35  `` I can see positives for the Greens with either Bush or Gore being president , '' she said .

Error is due to mismatch between our conventions and ACE conventions.  They have only one entity.
