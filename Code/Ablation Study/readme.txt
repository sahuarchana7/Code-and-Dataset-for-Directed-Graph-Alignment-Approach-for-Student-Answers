# Steps to obtain the evaluation results for Ablation Study

1. The student answers in each of the datasets, UNT, Scientsbank, Beetle have been categorized into two groups as shown in Dataset/Ablation Study folder:
   a) One group is comprised of student answers in which the directionality information in their respective answer graphs is of utmost importance for better understanding (total-dir.txt) 
   b) The other group is comprised of student answers where the directionality information is not vital (nodir.txt).

2. The performance of the proposed directed FA model and System-I are evaluated for each of the groups by running the code evaluation-gaps.py 
   to obtain results for the proposed FA models and System-I.
