1. We convert the annotator-ratings corresponding to .xlsx files in Dataset/Vetting-based strategy folder to .csv file by running the code convert-to-csv.py. 

2. Calculate the count / number of student answers for which the gaps annotated by first annotator are in agreement with the second annotator and hence compute the percentage of the same so as to obtain the vetting results. This can be achieved by running count-agree.py.
