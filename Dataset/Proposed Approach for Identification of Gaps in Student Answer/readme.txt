# readme.txt

This folder contains the student answers and model answers from ScientsBank dataset taken for illustrative purpose in reference to the code in https://github.com/sahuarchana7/Code-and-Dataset-for-Directed-Graph-Alignment-Approach-for-Student-Answers/Code/Proposed Approach for Identification of Gaps in Student Answer location.

It also contains all the questions from all the datasets UNT , ScientsBank, Beetle whose student answers and model answers have been used by the proposed approach to identify gaps in the student answers. 

A subset of the wikipedia articles is present in wikiArticles.txt that has been used to train a pre-trained model for determining vectors corresponding to words in each of the student answers. These vectors have been clustered using K-means clustering approach and used further in the proposed approach for gap-identification.
Due to space constraints, the original file used to train the pre-trained model couldn't be uploaded.
