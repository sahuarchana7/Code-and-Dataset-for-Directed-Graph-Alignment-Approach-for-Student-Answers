MX.16a.366.1	No the saturated solutions do not because they are not the same amount of water and it will not equal the same.
MX.16a.386.1	No, because there is less room for the solute to spread out in the person's solution. The material at the bottom is not part of the solution.
MX.16a.389.1	Yes because the saturated solutions both have the same amount of solid.
FN.19b.103.1	Putting the bag of yeast, warm whatever the food sample one are tasting.
FN.19b.106.1	Whichever food has the most carbohydrates has more sugar. And that is how a person will know her results.
FN.19b.139.1	Finally a person will have to get a volume tube put the bag in it and press down. Then one are done.
FN.19b.145.1	A person will know which food contains the most sugar by how high the volume tube goes. Look at the one with the highest number or highest volume tube.
FN.19b.152.1	If the food puffs up more that means that it has sugar in it.
FN.19b.176.1	A person will know because the bag that was highest in the volume tube when pressing down has the most sugar.
MS.39.115.1	Because one could not make measurement without a standard unit.
MS.39.569.1	If one has a standard measurement one can get the correct answer and one does not have the wrong answer.
MS.39.598.1	One uses a standard unit so one does not get the measurement wrong.
MS.39.600.1	It is important to use a standard unit when making a measurement because it is a standard unit.
PS.44.145.1	The short string has a higher pitch sound.
PS.44.194.1	The lower pitch makes the loudest noise.
PS.44.225.1	The shorter the string the higher the pitch the Longer the string the lower the pitch.
PS.44.255.1	The shorter string has a higher pitch than the longer string !
FN.20b.171.1	By looking at the scale and seeing which one is lower.
FN.20b.219.1	A grease spot will appear whatever grease spot is bigger that food has more fat.
FN.20b.298.1	The oil or fat will have spread on the paper.
FN.20b.615.1	And the person can help one to measure the cup.
MX.16a.436.1	No because Mariella's solution is more concentrated because her solution has less water so it has taste more sweeter or saltier.
MX.16a.492.1	Yes because both the saturated solutions have the same amount of water.
MX.16a.497.1	Yes , because if the same amount of solute and make a saturated solution the concentration would be the same if the solutions had the same volume.
MX.16a.636.1	No because one has 100 milliliters of water and the other has 250 milliliters of water.
FN.19b.216.1	The person will know which food contains the most sugar by comparing the amount of carbon dioxide each food sample has.
FN.19b.424.1	The bag will be full of carbohydrate and it will be fat.
FN.19b.514.1	The person will know by measuring the sample also whichever has more bubbles.
FN.19b.532.1	Whichever one has the highest volume.
EM.13.397.1	The difference between a rock and minerals are that a mineral is made of rock.
EM.13.401.1	A rock is made up of minerals but minerals can not be made up of minerals.
EM.13.429.1	A rock is made up of minerals and a mineral is just one substance.
EM.13.435.1	A rock does not bubble or fizz. If one puts it in vinegar a mineral does or does not bubble and fizz.
EM.13.452.1	A rock can be broken up and one can find minerals , a mineral can be broken up but all one will find is more of that mineral.
EM.13.488.1	A rock is made out of lots of stuff and a mineral is made out of things.
EM.13.489.1	A rock is made out of lots of things. A mineral is only made out of one thing.
EM.13.498.1	A mineral has one mineral in it and a rock has all this minerals in it.
EM.13.501.1	A rock has one thing and a mineral has a lot of stuff in it.
EM.13.508.1	Minerals are in rocks. The rocks are minerals put together.
EM.13.522.1	Not all rocks are hard and some can be scratched. Some minerals are hard and some can be crushed.
EM.13.533.1	A rock is hard a mineral is in a rock because a rock is made from minerals.
EM.13.537.1	Mineral is something in a rock a rock is a hard cement kind of.
EM.13.564.1	A rock is made with different materials and a mineral is made with elements.
EM.13.598.1	The rocks have many size. The mineral have space , size and color.
EM.13.602.1	A rock is made out of more than one mineral. And a mineral is made out of one thing.
EM.13.605.1	A rock has more than one substances. A mineral only has one substance.
EM.13.606.1	A rock has more than one thing and a mineral does not.
EM.13.632.1	A mineral is made of only one substance but a rock is made of many minerals.
EM.13.645.1	Rocks are made out of mineral and mineral is made out of crystals.
EM.33b.427.1	Because the paperclip is an easier item to scratch a rock or mineral than a penny.
EM.33b.432.1	One knows because the paperclip is a harder tool so if a softer tool can scratch it so can the paperclip.
EM.33b.436.1	A paperclip is harder because one scratched the penny with the paperclip. The penny got a scratch.
EM.33b.452.1	A paperclip is harder than a penny.
EM.33b.466.1	If the paperclip scratches the mineral then the penny scratches it because they are almost the same hardness.
EM.33b.467.1	Because the penny is the middle hardness and the paperclip is the hardest that is how one knows it should be scratched.
EM.33b.488.1	Because if mineral is kind of hard as a penny.
EM.33b.492.1	If the hardest tool can scratch the mineral then the second hardest can.
EM.33b.499.1	A paperclip is harder than a penny and the paperclip is like a penny.
EM.33b.504.1	If a washer scratched the mineral and the paperclip is harder than the washer than it would scratch the mineral too.
EM.33b.523.1	A paperclip is the hardest so if a penny can a paperclip can.
EM.33b.532.1	Because the paperclip is just like a penny.
EM.33b.561.1	A paperclip is also hard and it can make a mark.
EM.33b.570.1	Because paperclip is bigger and harder.
EM.33b.573.1	Because paperclip is harder and it can not scratch the mineral.
EM.33b.593.1	Because a penny is a little bit harder than a fingernail and if a penny scratches a fingernail would scratch.
EM.33b.609.1	Because the paperclip is the hardest tool and the penny is almost the hardest so the paperclip can scratch the mineral.
ME.36.108.1	The bulbs are dim because they have to share a path. They are bright because they do not have to share a pathway.
ME.36.123.1	Because with a parallel the bulbs have their own pathway.
ME.36.146.1	In a series the bulbs do not have enough energy to flow through it. In a parallel the bulbs has a enough out energy to flow through.
ME.36.173.1	The bulbs are dim on the series circuit because the series circuit does not have a circuit. The parallel is bright because the bulbs have a circuit.
ME.36.181.1	The bulbs are very bright because they each have their own pathway.
ME.36.185.1	In the series circuit there is a disconnection in the wiring. In a parallel circuit the energy flows straight to the bulb , goes through and keeps going in a circuit.
ME.36.206.1	The light bulbs are dim because in a series circuit they share some of the same connections.
ME.36.214.1	The bulbs are dim in a series because they are using each other's energy , the lights are bright in a parallel because the bulbs are not sharing energy with each other.
ME.36.215.1	One gets more power than the other.
ME.36.226.1	The bulbs are dim in a series and bright in a parallel because parallel is 2 or more and a series is only one way. So parallel is stronger.
ME.36.253.1	The bulbs are dim in series and bright in parallel because the 2 bulbs were new and the other bulbs were probably old.
ME.36.277.1	The lights are dim in a series circuit because they share the same circuit , and bright in a parallel circuit because they do not share.
ME.36.278.1	The bulbs are dim in a series circuit because one of the bulbs is taking all of the electricity. The bulbs are bright in the parallel circuit because they are sharing electricity.
ME.36.313.1	In the series circuit the bulbs are dim because there is only one bulb. In the parallel circuit there are 2 bulbs so the bulbs are bright.
ME.36.328.1	The bulbs in a series circuit are dim because there is only one pathway for electricity and in a parallel circuit there is more than one pathway.
SE.27b.103.1	No , There are 2 different things.
SE.27b.105.1	No , Because the bulb would be little warm. It would be hotter if the student would not be grabbing the bulb.
SE.27b.120.1	No , the thermometer would not read the same temperature because the heat on one's hand heats the thermometer.
SE.27b.133.1	No , No because the temperature will rise like 4 or 5 degrees.
SE.27b.139.1	No , The temperature will change when one holds the thermometer by the bulb because one's hand and body is warm so the temperature will go high.
SE.27b.184.1	Yes , One thinks yes because if one puts one's thumb there the heat from one's body makes oneself heat in one's own body.
SE.27b.243.1	No , Because of that student 's body heat.
SE.27b.265.1	Yes , Well the alcohol needs the sun or shade to change the bulb of the thermometer , but if something or someone is blocking it , the alcohol will not go neither up nor down.
SE.27b.316.1	No , Because if a student had the thermometer by the bulb the thermometer would measure the temperature of his or her body not the object.
SE.27b.323.1	No , Because the thermometer would read how cold or hot is the bulb and that is what it would read.
SE.27b.333.1	Yes , Because if one put one's hand on the round part the air is not going to feel thermometer.
SE.27b.416.1	No , if a person held a thermometer by the bulb then the thermometer would sense one's hands and the degrees would rise.
SE.27b.514.1	No , the temperature would not be the same because the thermometer would be taking in the body temperature.
SE.27b.538.1	No , the temperature would be warmer because the warmth and pressure of one's fingers would give warmth to the bulb.
SE.27b.605.1	No , No because the temperature would be changed.
WA.18.383.1	Water evaporation is also predicted by the volume mass.
WA.18.385.1	A person disagrees because the surface area effects the evaporation. Also it just takes more time when the water is cold.
WA.18.451.1	A person agrees because anything with water on it in the heat will evaporate.
WA.18.455.1	A person disagrees because water can evaporate when it is breezy too.
WA.18.456.1	A person disagrees because water can evaporate at any temperature.
WA.18.465.1	A person disagrees. Water can evaporate at any temperature. Make the water make it evaporate faster.
WA.18.469.1	A person agrees because heat can help the time of evaporation.
WA.22.182.1	Both evaporation and condensation are processes that involve causing rain because first, when there is a cup of water, the sun would evaporate the water and turn it into water vapor, then the water vapor would touch a cool surface and start condensation. Then the condensation would go to the clouds and cause rain.
WA.22.207.1	One chooses both evaporation and condensation because when water evaporates it turns into water vapor when there is enough it forms rain clouds then condensation happens and forms rain.
WA.22.212.1	Was evaporation makes a cloud full of water vapor then that cloud becomes rain.
WA.22.221.1	Because but evaporation is air condensation is like cloud and rain.
WA.22.223.1	Because evaporation causes the water to go up in the air, and condensation makes clouds which eventually form precipitation or rain.
WA.22.227.1	Because water gets evaporated.
WA.22.229.1	Evaporation and condensation both have something to do with rain because evaporation evaporates the water into the air and makes it water vapor. The water vapor condenses and makes clouds filled with water and then the cloud touches a cool surface and condensation makes the liquid water back into water and it rains.
WA.21.461.1	Ice expands instead of contracts.
WA.21.497.1	Because 0 degrees Celsius is the freezing point of water. When water freezes it expands. The water bottle cracked because the ice needed more room than the water.
WA.21.510.1	0 degrees Celsius is 32 degrees Fahrenheit and when the temperature is 32 degrees Fahrenheit the water froze and when water freezes the ice expands.
WA.21.521.1	Because if one leaves a cup or bottle of water outside when the temperature is 0 degrees Celsius it will crack.
WA.21.522.1	The bottle gets so cold and froze that it cracked the plastic bottle.
WA.21.523.1	Because the water in the water bottle froze and it expanded and it did not have enough room, so it cracked.
WA.21.534.1	The bottle cracked because water expands when the temperature hits the freezing point.
