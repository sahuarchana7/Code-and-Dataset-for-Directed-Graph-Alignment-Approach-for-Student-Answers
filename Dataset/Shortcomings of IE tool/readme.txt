The true gaps for randomly selected subset of student answers in ScientsBank are contained in the file sel_tr_gaps.txt.

The randomly selected subset of student answers in ScientsBank can be identified from the student-ids in the file sel_tr_gaps.txt for which the true gaps are indicated. 

This folder also contains the file having gaps extracted in student answers (randomly selected from ScientsBank) using new triples (manually-generated triples for a pair of student-answer and model-answer) in the proposed approach for gap-identification. The folder also contains the file having gaps extracted in student answers (randomly selected from ScientsBank) using old triples (triples generated using ClausIE tool for a pair of student-answer and model-answer) in the proposed approach for gap-identification.
